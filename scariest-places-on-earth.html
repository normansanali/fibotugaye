K. Madhawl reported finding bones at the lake, which is located 16,000 feet above sea level. Though the lake froze in the winter, the summer months would eventually reveal even more skeletons, baffling experts.</p><p>At first, some reasoned that the more than 200 skeletons that washed ashore might have belonged to Japanese troops who died of exposure during World War II. But an examination by British scientists revealed that the skeletons were not nearly as young as they appeared.</p><p>Thus, the World War II theory quickly fell apart. And it would take decades for the mystery of this creepy place to finally be solved.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-450007 alt="Creepy Places" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/roopkund-lake-in-the-winter.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-450007 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Neha iitb/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Roopkund Lake in the winter. When the lake thawed in the warm months in the 1940s, it started to reveal skeletons.</span></p><p>In 2004, researchers in Hyderabad studied the Roopkund Lake skeletons anew using DNA evidence and updated technology. They found that the remains dated back to 850 C.E. and that they could be split into two groups: a family or tribe connected by DNA and several unrelated people who were smaller in stature. The researchers hypothesized that the smaller people had been hired to lead the family or tribe through the region.</p><p>Significantly, researchers also determined that the skeletons had suffered from fatal blows to the head and shoulders. Because the blows appeared to have been left by round objects instead of weapons, the researchers came to believe that the entire 200-person party was killed by a freak hailstorm.</p><p>Though some of the Roopkund Lake skeletons have disappeared over time, many still remain along the lake’s shores. To some, this makes the Indian lake, the site of a centuries-old tragedy, one of the scariest places on Earth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0r8CroJ6rpGK9ra3Cnqpmp55isqK%2B06Fmbg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
