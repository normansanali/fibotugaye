Its transformation means beaches and balls, fortune hunters, romance, and yes, heartbreak. The story is inspired by Jane Austen’s final unfinished novel and the much-talked-about adaptation has ignited a deeply passionate fanbase. Alas, Sanditon’s third season is its last and we must ardently hope our youthful heroine Charlotte finds everlasting happiness.</p><p><strong>Cast & Characters:</strong> Audiences are greeted by returning characters Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams), Georgiana Lambe (Crystal Clarke), Alexander Colbourne (Ben Lloyd-Hughes), Tom Parker (Kris Marshall), Mary Parker (Kate Ashfield), Lady Denham (Anne Reid), Edward Denham (Jack Fox), Arthur Parker (Turlough Convery), and other beloved residents of the seaside resort town.</p><p>Intriguing new characters include an estranged brother for Coulbourne played by Liam Garrigan, a dare-we-say love interest for Lady Denham in the shape of one Rowleigh Pryce (James Bolam), and the aristocratic but not altogether trustworthy Montrose family, whose matriarch (Emma Fielding) has the sole objective of marrying off her daughter Lydia (Alice Orr-Ewing) and son Harry (Edward Davis).</p><p>Stream <a href=# rel=noopener>Seasons 1, 2 and 3 of Sanditon with PBS Passport</a>.</p></li><li><span class=number>2.</span><h3>Tom Jones</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/c_Coming_in_2023_Tom-Jones1920x1080-1024x576.jpg><p>MASTERPIECE brings audiences a modern reimagining of Henry Fielding’s 1749 classic, The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling. The story of the title character’s complicated journey to find true love, Tom Jones has both bewitched and astonished readers since it was first published. “Tom Jones is the mother of all romcoms,” says writer and Executive Producer Gwyneth Hughes (Vanity Fair, Miss Austen Regrets). “Fielding’s 18th century novel is sexy and fun; it’s also a dramatic rollercoaster, addressing modern concerns around consent, sexual equality and the pursuit of happiness.”</p><p><strong>Cast & Characters:</strong> Solly McLeod (House of the Dragon) stars as the handsome, resourceful Tom Jones, with Sophie Wilde (You Don’t Know Me) as the bright, beautiful, and seemingly unattainable love of his life, Sophia Western. Emmy®-winning actress Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso) plays the seductive and vengeful Lady Bellaston, who comes between Tom and Sophia.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Stream all four episodes of Tom Jones </a>now with PBS Passport.</p></li><li><span class=number>3.</span><h3>Endeavour Season 9</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/endeavour-s8-official-preview-1920x1080-1-1024x576.jpg><p>The Oxford-set detective drama stars Shaun Evans as the young Endeavour Morse, a prequel to the original Inspector Morse series on MASTERPIECE Mystery! … and it’s a bit of a gem. Each episode delivers a truly satisfying mystery that is both enjoyable to follow and not terribly easy to puzzle out! The show also features a memorable partnership, which has evolved over the years: that of sensible DI Fred Thursday and the multi-layered Morse.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>After 10 phenomenally successful years on the telly, stars Shaun Evans and Roger Allum, along with screenwriter Russell Lewis, have decided to finish the Detective Sergeant’s narrative with Season 9.</p><p><strong>Cast & Characters:</strong> Beloved central characters return for what promises to be a poignant farewell, including Shaun Evans as DS Morse, Roger Allum as the gruffly loveable DCI Fred Thursday, Anton Lesser as by-the-book CS Reginald Bright, Sean Rigby as the good and reliable DS Jim Strange, and Sara Vickers as Joan Thursday.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Stream Seasons 1 through 9 of Endeavour</a> now on PBS Passport.</p></li><li><span class=number>4.</span><h3>Grantchester Season 8</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GrantchesterS4TomRobsonIcon_3200x1800-1024x576.jpg><p>Grantchester provides the winning combination of a perceptive amateur detective (who happens to be village vicar), paired with a plodding policeman as his foil. Season 8’s storylines will be explosive—exploring faith, forgiveness, and redemption—and testing Will and Geordie to the limit.</p><p><strong>Cast & Characters: </strong>All the show’s regulars are back: Vicar Will Davenport (Tom Brittney), Detective Geordie Keating (Robson Green), Leonard Finch (Al Weaver), Mrs. Sylvia Chapman (Tessa Peake-Jones), Cathy Keating (Kacey Ainsworth), Daniel Marlow (Oliver Dimsdale), Jack Chapman (Nick Brimble), and Will’s new wife Bonnie (Charlotte Ritchie).</p><p><strong>More About Season 8: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Read more about Season 8</a> and take a look at <a href=# rel=noopener>our guide to the Grantchester books in order</a>.</p><p>Stream <a href=# rel=noopener>Seasons 1 to 8 of Grantchester with PBS Passport</a>.</p></li><li><span class=number>5.</span><h3>Unforgotten Season 5</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Unforgotten-s3-e6-icon-3200x1800-1024x576.jpg><p>This award-winning police procedural about unearthing cold crimes and bringing truth to light has a much-anticipated return in 2023. Fans and critics alike believe the show does many things right. It builds layers of complication, but not too many. It leaves solid clues about the true culprit, but you’ll still be surprised. And it’s propelled by reserved and compassionate detectives who strike us as real heroes.</p><p><strong>Cast & Characters:</strong> Beyond actor Sanjeev Bhaskar’s return as Sunny Khan, no further casting updates have been divulged. The show’s writer/creator Chris Lang does however acknowledge that Season 5 “introduces a new partner in crime for [DI Sunny Khan], which is just lovely and refreshing. It’s a woman and she’s pretty different from Cassie [DCI Cassie Stuart], that’s kind of all I can say. She’s at a very different stage in her life. She’s younger. She’s his boss again.”</p><p><strong>More About Season 5:</strong> Check out exclusive interviews with <a href=# rel=noopener>Sanjeev Bhaskar</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Sinéad Keenan</a> as they form a new team for a new season.</p><p>Stream Unforgotten Seasons 1 through 5 when you watch with <a href=# rel=noopener>PBS Passport</a>.</p></li><li><span class=number>6.</span><h3>Van Der Valk Season 3</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/c_Coming_in_2023_Van-der-Valk_1920x1080-1024x576.jpg><p>Amsterdam is a city of bikes, boats, and bodies. At least that’s the way steely-eyed cop Piet Van der Valk sees his murder-infested beat. Marc Warren (Beecham House,&nbsp;The Good Wife) stars as the title character in&nbsp;Van der Valk, based on Nicolas Freeling’s legendary crime thrillers. Filmed on location, the series showcases all the sights, sounds, and cultural contrasts of this great city.</p><p><strong>Cast & Characters: </strong>Along with Marc Warren, we know Maimie McCoy reprises her role as Inspector Lucienne Hassell, and Darrell D’Silva returns as team pathologist Hendrik Davie as does Emma Fielding as Chief Commissaris Julia Dahlman.

When the series returns, we’ll join our characters in October 1940, when lone pilots were sent to destroy German bombers as the Northern Blitz began. Audiences will be taken from the streets of Britain into occupied France, Nazi Germany, and to the sands of the North African desert.</p><p><strong>Cast & Characters:</strong> The diverse cast includes Academy Award®-nominee Lesley Manville (<a href=# rel=noopener>Magpie Murders</a>, Phantom Thread) as Robina, Jonah Hauer-King (<a href=# rel=noopener>Little Women</a>,&nbsp;Howard’s End) as Harry, Julia Brown as Lois, Zofia Wichlacz as Kasia, and Blake Harrison as Stan, among others.
