It’s the time when life slows down just a tad and there’s more time to enjoy the pure, simple joy of a hot, freshly made breakfast. Since it’s Memorial Day weekend and the family is getting together, it’s the perfect time to share one of our family favorites – the Fruit Pancake Stack with Coconut Syrup and Freshly Whipped Cream.</p><p>If you read my Dutch Baby Puff Pancake post&nbsp;<a href=#>https://www.modernhoney.com/dutch-baby-puff-pancake/</a>&nbsp;you know by now how much my kids LOVE breakfast. &nbsp;They are obsessed. The problem is that on most school days, I am way too lazy to whip them up fancy breakfasts. This mama is tired! So I always promise them a big breakfast on the weekend.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0806ed6-1.jpg alt="Fruit Pancake Stack with Coconut Syrup by Modern Honey I www.modernhoney.com" width=2398 height=2829 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>One Saturday as I was flipping pancakes and asking the kiddos what they wanted on top of their buttery pancakes, they all gave me a different answer. My daughter wanted strawberries, bananas and cream and my boys wanted blackberries and blueberries. The lightbulb went on! I decided to put every single fruit I had in the refrigerator on the pancakes and stack them as high as I could because everything looks prettier stacked. This is how the Fruit Pancake Stack with Coconut Syrup was born.</p><p>This Fruit Pancake Stack is layered with fresh fruits and drizzled with a tropical homemade coconut syrup. &nbsp;The coconut syrup is made with four ingredients and is easy to whip up. It is the perfect accompaniment to buttery golden pancakes and fresh fruit. This way you can grab a few buttermilk pancakes and choose your favorite fruit.</p><p>Let’s not forget about the freshly whipped cream. Handcrafted whipped cream is so underrated. It doesn’t take much time to whip heavy whipping cream and the effort makes all of the difference. This recipe calls for Goldie’s Buttermilk Pancakes because they are so tender and perfect. Buttermilk is the star ingredient in these pancakes.&nbsp;<a href=#>https://www.modernhoney.com/goldies-banana-walnut-buttermilk-pancakes-with-fayes-syrup/</a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSC_0810edit.jpg alt="Fruit Pancake Stack with Coconut Syrup by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com" width=2339 height=2614 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=1769 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/fruit-pancake-stack-coconut-syrup/>Pin It</a><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-ingredient-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Goldie's Buttermilk Pancakes:</h4><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-ingredient-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Coconut Syrup:</h4><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-ingredient-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Fresh Fruits:</h4><h4 class="wprm-recipe-group-name wprm-recipe-ingredient-group-name wprm-block-text-bold">Whipped Cream:</h4><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=14><li id=wprm-recipe-12671-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=7><p>In large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar and stir until combined.
