Swifties are clever detectives who analyze social media pages and interviews for clues and Easter eggs, and when she puts out new <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong>, they waste no time trying to guess who each song is about. Even if "Getaway Car" from "Reputation" isn't a <a href=#>song about Tom Hiddleston</a>, it's fun to imagine that it could be.</p><p>There's no doubt that several tunes off "Tortured Poets" will be added to the list of the <a href=#>singer's most popular songs</a> . After Taylor Swift released her music video for her first single "Fortnight," people did even more detective work. <a href=#>Fans thought Swift and Alwyn were engaged</a> because she had a garter on in one scene. They also noticed something else: <strong>Swift had tattoos in the video</strong>. Swift's "Fortnight" collaborator <a href=#>Post Malone has countless tattoos</a> and in one scene, Post Malone's tattoos get transferred to Swift's face, which is a fun image. This made everyone curious about Swift's tattoo status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>the mystery surrounding whether Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift have tattoos</strong>, along with a closer look at their six-year relationship.</p><h2 id=do-joe-alwyn-and-taylor-swift-have-tattoos>Do Joe Alwyn And Taylor Swift Have Tattoos?</h2><p><strong>Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift's tattoo status is a mystery</strong> because <strong>neither singer has said they have tattoos</strong>.</p><p>According to Extra TV, there is no indication that Alwyn is tattooed. When Swift sang the lyrics "Like a tattooed golden retriever" in her song "The Tortured Poets Department," she might have been referencing Matty Healy, not Alwyn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/why-joe-alwyn-s-mysterious-parents-were-almost-never-spotted-anywhere-near-taylor-swift-front-back-deposit.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's possible that Joe Alwyn has secret tattoos that don't show in any photos and that he doesn't talk about.

He said:</p><p>"It's not really [because I] want to be guarded and private, it's more a response to something else. We live in a culture that is so increasingly intrusive … the more you give — and frankly, even if you don't give it — something will be taken."</p><p>There is also some mystery about whether Swift has any tattoos. At the time of this writing, <strong>Swift has never admitted to having tattoos</strong>, and she never said anything about having body ink in 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ttweb_joe-alwyn-changed-his-relationship-to-his-dating-life-after-breaking-up-with-taylor-swift_bk_a1_v4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2012, the singer spoke to Taste of Country and said that she liked writing song lyrics on her arms but didn't want to get a tattoo.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:19</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-s-relationship-with-travis-kelce-is-drastically-different-from-her-past-famous-romances-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift’s Relationship With Travis Kelce Is Drastically Different From Her Past Famous Romances</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There are a lot of unique things about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's fascinating relationship.</span><p>Swift said:</p><p>"And for me, people are always asking, 'Would you get a tattoo?'

She sounded disgusted at the idea of getting ink on her body. However, that interview took place in 2012 when she was 23 years old, and as of April 2024, she is 34. She might have changed her mind and gotten a tattoo... but she might not want her fans to know about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-5.jpg><p>It's interesting to note that <strong>Taylor Swift has gotten fake tattoos for music videos </strong>in the past. It seems that her "Fortnight" tattoo was a temporary one, and in 2021, Swift had a back tattoo in her video for "ME!" While <a href=#>fans consider this Swift's worst song</a>, the video was cool. The singer sported a tattoo that had a snake and several butterflies. But just like the "Fortnight" video made fans wonder if Swift had a secret tattoo, it was hard not to think that the "ME!" video tattoo was real.</p><h2 id=inside-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-39-s-relationship>Inside Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Relationship</h2><p>While Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's tattoo status may be mysterious, so was their six-year relationship.

While they might have started dating a bit before then, no one is sure of the exact date. As time passed, the two became more serious but kept their relationship secretive. While they went on vacations and even attended award shows together, they never seemed to want people to know much about their romance.</p><p><strong>Alwyn and Swift split up in April 2023 </strong>and a source told People that Alwyn had a hard time:</p><p>"With Taylor's level of fame and the attention from the public."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-s-most-quotable-lyrics-ranked-1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Most Quotable Lyrics Ranked, According To Reddit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Since the start of her career with Tim McGraw, and now with her 'Taylor's Version' albums, Swift has had some of the most quotable song lyrics.</span><p>Which "The Tortured Poets Department" Songs Might Be About Joe Alwyn?
