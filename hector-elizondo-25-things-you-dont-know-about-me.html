Then I investigate the wildlife activity in my backyard while my cup of joe boils, and gather my newspapers — yes, newspapers.</p><p>3. I marvel at neighbors who seem to be taking their cellphones for a morning walk and never look up at [nature].</p><p>4. The Father of the Blues, W.C. Handy, happened to catch my school performance, and the next thing I knew I had my first professional job, appearing on The Okey-Dokey Ranch House with Wendy Barrie. I was 10.</p><p>5.
