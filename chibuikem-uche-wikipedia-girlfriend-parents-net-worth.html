McManus, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>One of Us Is Lying</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> followed the murder mystery of Sam, who ends up in detention but never makes it out. Before his death, Simon Kelleher (Mark McKenna) a.k.a Sam made a provoking post on “About That” — promising forthcoming exposures on four anonymous students.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Coincidentally, there were four other students in detention with Sam that day — Cooper Clay (portrayed by Chibuikem Uche), Adelaide “Addy” Prentiss (Annalisa Cochrane), Nate Macauley (Cooper van Grootel), and Bronwyn Rojas (Marian Tejada). Naturally, they became the prime suspects after his untimely death.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to the show’s creator Darío Madrona, they made sure to keep </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>One of Us Is Lying</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>‘s story arc as close as possible to the novel. “We all love the book, so we wanted to be faithful to it,” he shared.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, the show also featured “some little twists and turns here and there” so they could surprise readers of the book.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Chibuikem’s take on the show, he shared that the cast was amazing and they bonded offset too. “The first day that we met, it was at a diner in North Hollywood. We were supposed to grab lunch, and we were together for 9 hours. And so from then on, it was like, ‘Okay, I think we can work together,’” Chibuikem shared.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, he went on to add that since the book was popular, there was a bit of pressure to represent these characters and play them well.</span></p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>One of Us Is Lying</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> premiered on the streaming platform Peacock on October 7, 2021, and its final two episodes aired on October 21.</span></p><h3><b>Does Chibuikem Uche Have A Girlfriend?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2021, Chibuikem Uche just stepped into the entertainment industry.
