Now, losing a job is NOWHERE near losing everything but this much is true: exactly one year ago, I was asked to return to a job that I had done successfully – for almost a decade. This time around though, my position was given to someone else.”</p><p class=p1>He continued, “Not gonna lie, my ego took a huge punch to the gut. It stung. And it left me SO confused. I began doubting my talent, my experience and my overall belief in myself. But the job was never about me! … Honestly, it WAS and always will be, one of the best experiences I’ve ever had.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Instead of hosting, Pennington appeared on the HGTV revival as a special guest before finding a new gig on the network’s&nbsp;<i>Battle on the Beach&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Ty Breaker.</i></p><p class=p3>“To put a happy ending on this sad little narcissistic story…. saying yes to a lesser job made me remember to appreciate those bigger jobs when you get them,” he continued in the post. “Fast forward to one year later, I’m working on a new show that I helped create. … So please, be patient. Have faith. Something good is coming – just give it time. Believe in yourself; you deserve to be as good as you KNOW you can be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatsV2lsq%2B6yKeeraeeYra0ecSnnpqflZl6tbuMoKCrpJantqa6w2ainqScmrJuucSrqZ6knGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
