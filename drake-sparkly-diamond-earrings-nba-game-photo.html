Now, the 33-year-old has debuted his latest accessory: a pair of sparkly diamond earrings. He unveiled the glittering jewels while sitting courtside at a Toronto Raptors game on Feb. 22. The Canadian rapper has been the team’s global ambassador since 2013, and is arguably their biggest fan! The “God’s Plan” singer could be seen salsa dancing on the sidelines, and joined the team’s broadcast duo for some on-air commentating. Along with the new bling, Drake rocked a jean jacket with a fur trim, black jeans, and white Nike sneakers. Fans on Twitter were quick to notice the rapper’s earrings, and they were divided. “Drake be lookin good with those big earrings in,” one fan write, while another quipped, “Drake looks goofy with those earrings.” To each their own!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Drake first got his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ears pierced</a> on Dec. 20, 2019 in a hotel in Atlanta, GA. <strong>Otniel Pichardo</strong>, who is the owner of Atlanta Ink, a tattoo and piercing business in the ATL, and his business partners showed up to get the job done after Drizzy’s team called them up and requested a personal session with him. Piercer&nbsp;<strong>Christian Verrette</strong>&nbsp;shared some eye-catching pics with Drake and his newly pierced ears to his Instagram page shortly after the session was done along with a caption full of nice words. “@champagnepapi I’m a big fan, this was a real honor bro!

One pic also shows Christian preparing the process at the hotel and another shows the “Hotline Bling” hitmaker posing with Otniel, Christian, and Otniel’s other partner, <strong>CJ</strong>.
