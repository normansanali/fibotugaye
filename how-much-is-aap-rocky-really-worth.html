Born on October 3, 1988, Rocky started getting a feel of how hard life can get at a very young age. When he was just 12, Rocky watched his father go to prison for dealing drugs. Barely a year later, the rapper's older brother, Ricky, was murdered by members of a rival drug-dealing gang.</p><p>Following his brother's passing, Rocky and the rest of his family were forced to move in between homeless shelters for a while. Given his father and brother's history with drugs, it was therefore only a matter of time before Rocky himself found himself in the drug dealing bubble â€“- but only for a short time.</p><p>"I wasn't no big-time hustler," he told <a href=#>Billboard</a> in 2015. "I was one of those guys that would do well in the summer and save enough to support my studio time, buy clothes, pay the bills. That lifestyle's wack." The rapper also recounted his "crazy" childhood experiences to <a href=#>Red Bull Academy</a> during a 2015 interview. "Those kids, those guys, man, it was a crazy experience ... I remember being like 13 and to challenge their strength, just to see how strong they was, they would just try to like knock out delivery dudes just going past on bikes. That was fun to them. To see a 14-year-old knock a grown man out was just like, that's how you test your strength."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG5nbIZ2e8eormalpZi1brXSZpiaqF2nvKS32GapnpmcocZuw86rq6Fn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
