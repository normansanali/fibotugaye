I have made friends for life, and I will be with them in spirit.”</p><p>This year, because of coronavirus, the bakers all lived together in a bubble for the entire time.</p><p>Showing his good nature, Jürgen said he felt thrilled for his friends for making it through to the end. “I am really proud for the other three bakers to be in the final, they deserve it.</p><p>“We helped each other out all the way and during practice there was never any spark of competition. By the time we got to the semi-final we were close friends and we all appreciated each others’ unique baking styles and personalities.
