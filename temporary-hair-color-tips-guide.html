That's where temporary hair colors come up big. These fun, vibrant formulas wash out after a few shampoos so there's little commitment involved (good news if you end up hating the way it looks).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We spoke to an expert hair colorist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Steph Perry</a>, who teaches a class on alternative hair tints, to find the best temporary hair dye products for every purpose.

To this day, it is a favorite amongst those looking to experiment with hair color. "The brand's temporary, washable, easy-to-apply dyes are all over the internet and in every mall in America," says Perry. Manic Panic offers shades ranging from soft pastels to wild neons and the colors can be mixed, a bonus if you like to play chemist. The formula is also vegan, and cruelty-, paraben-, and phthalate-free to cause less damage to your hair. Heads up: While it works on all hair types, Perry warns that the color will last longer on naturally light hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;1.66 fl oz |&nbsp;<strong>Type:</strong>&nbsp;Gel |&nbsp;<strong>Sulfate-Free:&nbsp;</strong>Yes |&nbsp;<strong>Shades:</strong>&nbsp;11+ |&nbsp;<strong>Number of Washes:&nbsp;</strong>12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-loral-paris-colorista-1-day-washable-temporary-hair-color-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L’Oréal Paris Temporary Hair Color Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Oreal Paris Colorista 1-Day Washable Temporary Hair Color Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8GD81cx5vzToMWAKuF7GfY4hfNY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loreal-ae504289915c405eb0c6148b293d3981.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This affordable hair spray by L'Oreal Paris will give you a bold pop of color without breaking the bank.

"Unfortunately bright color doesn't show up as well on dark hair without bleaching, but Splat on its own definitely delivers a solid punch of color," says Perry. It comes with a custom applicator comb that makes applying the color easy and clean; product comes out through the comb, so it only goes on where you want it to and it stays put. There is also a conditioning base that is gentle on your hair and prevents damage. The formula is vegan, and cruelty-, gluten-, ammonia-, and paraben-free. Since the color payoff is incredibly vivid and designed for dark hair, Perry notes that if it is used on light hair it will really stay put for longer periods of time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;1.5 fl oz |&nbsp;<strong>Type:</strong>&nbsp;Gel |&nbsp;<strong>Sulfate-Free:&nbsp;</strong>Yes |&nbsp;<strong>Shades:</strong>&nbsp;8 |&nbsp;<strong>Number of Washes:</strong>&nbsp;1-2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-light-hair-lime-crime-anime-hair-color></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Light Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lime Crime Anime Hair Color</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lime Crime Anime Hair Color" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kQjXAzEARHeVtdzcBDp9YSQbJYQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lime-crime-anime-hair-color-9b0307b0876647e2bc2b9ce372c6820d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This semi-permanent hair color is one that will leave your hair looking both colorful and healthy. It has an ultra-conditioning formula, so it will transform your hair into vibrant colors without drying it out. "The formula goes on like a conditioner and leaves hair feeling soft and silky," says Perry. As an additional bonus, the formula has a sweet smell to it and is free of harmful parabens and sulfates.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;6.76 fl oz |&nbsp;<strong>Type:</strong>&nbsp;Gel |&nbsp;<strong>Sulfate-Free:&nbsp;</strong>Yes |&nbsp;<strong>Shades:</strong>&nbsp;24 |&nbsp;<strong>Number of Washes:</strong>&nbsp;1-2, varies by shade</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wax-mofajang-hair-coloring-material></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wax</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mofajang Hair Coloring Material</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mofajang Hair Coloring Material" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JIPog3p3bDXcXaV-hHimyNvQX3I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mofajang-3af8afd6012042f7893d588351f34884.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This hair wax glides on easily and works on any hair type. Its natural formula won't irritate the scalp or sensitive skin and is less damaging to your hair. It's also very easy to both use and wash out. "Its biggest perk includes its thick consistency, making it foolproof when wanting different strands different colors," says Perry. It comes in seven basic colors, which you can easily mix to create your perfect hue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;4.23 fl oz |&nbsp;<strong>Type:</strong>&nbsp;Wax |&nbsp;<strong>Sulfate-Free:</strong>&nbsp;Yes |&nbsp;<strong>Shades:</strong>&nbsp;7 |&nbsp;<strong>Number of Washes:</strong>&nbsp;1-2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-btz-color-bombz-explosive-black-temporary-hair-color-spray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BTZ Temporary Hair Color Spray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BTZ Color Bombz Explosive Black Temporary Hair Color Spray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QbuLM5NqSOtv8PoF_5ZgT3NseLw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BTZ-6e03ee19faa5487888ef7fb68f59448b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sally Beauty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're just looking to darken your hair without any commitment, this washable black hair spray will give you sultry jet black hair without permanently coloring or damaging your hair. Perry notes that it's not only one of the only all-black hair sprays on the market that doesn't stain light hair on a semi-permanent level, but it's also affordable and specially formulated without any harmful bleaches or peroxides. It works best on dry hair and should be applied at least 12 inches away from the hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;2 fl oz |&nbsp;<strong>Type:</strong>&nbsp;Spray |&nbsp;<strong>Sulfate-Free:</strong>&nbsp;No |&nbsp;<strong>Shades:</strong>&nbsp;1 |&nbsp;<strong>Number of Washes:</strong>&nbsp;1-2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-semi-permanent-joico-intensity-semi-permanent-hair-color></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Semi-Permanent</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Joico Semi-Permanent Hair Color</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Joico Intensity Semi-Permanent Hair Color" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/U9RvZ2kBN4lwhuwelBhU2nx4Fnk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/joico-22e31f68969b4ffc8be634ba682d4123.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For longer lasting color, this semi-permanent dye by Joico is a must-have. "[It's] absolutely my favorite for vibrant, healthy, intensely pigmented color," says Perry. "Each color comes out identical to what it's advertised to be and stays true to shade for 4 to 6 weeks, depending on how light the previous hair was and the washing routine." The color doesn't penetrate the hair strands either, so it is gentler than other dyes and causes less damage. The formula will also condition your hair, leaving it soft and shiny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;4 fl oz |&nbsp;<strong>Type:</strong>&nbsp;Gel |&nbsp;<strong>Sulfate-Free:</strong>&nbsp;No |&nbsp;<strong>Shades:</strong>&nbsp;20+ |&nbsp;<strong>Number of Washes:</strong>&nbsp;20</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ease of Use</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No one likes a mess, so when shopping for temporary hair color, it's important to make sure the product is easy to apply and won't get everywhere. For hair spray, keep in mind that you will have to be very careful with where you spray it. Dyes and waxes can also be a bit messy, so look for products that are sold with tools that make the application process easier, or try using gloves.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On top of transforming your hair's color, you will also want a product that does not damage your hair. The least damaging products are ones that use clean ingredients and exclude ingredients like ammonia, peroxide, sulfates, parabens or phthalates. Some products also have conditioning elements to them, which can strengthen hair and make it healthier.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Washability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The purpose of temporary hair color is to alter your hair for only a small amount of time, so the product should not permanently tint or color your hair and it should be relatively easy to wash out. Pay attention to whether a product is 'temporary' or 'semi-permanent' as that will dictate how long the color will last and how many washes it will require to get the color out. Some products can last for 4 to 6 weeks while others are designed for only 1-day use. For 1-day or shorter periods especially, you will want the color to easily come out in the shower without multiple washes or heavy scrubbing.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does temporary color change your natural hair color?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many people may be hesitant to try out temporary color due to the fear of permanently altering their natural hair color, but colorist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Joie Wallace</a> assures that there is nothing to worry about. "Semi-permanent or direct dyes work by layering color directly over the surface of your hair, without changing your natural color," she says. "If you dye your hair with something temporary or semi-permanent, it will gradually revert to its natural color." Depending on the product, and how permanent it is, it may take longer for your hair to return to its natural color, but the temporary color will eventually fade and vanish nevertheless.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does temporary color damage hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another common fear is causing damage to your hair, but according to Wallace, temporary dyes will not damage hair because they "do not contain harsh or permanent chemicals." In fact, temporary color can actually have many benefits for your hair, she notes. "They have moisturizers and vitamins that actually make it safe to use on hair that has been professionally relaxed or permed," Wallace says. "They also give the hair an amazing shine by filing in the cuticles of the hair shaft."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you wash out temporary hair color?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Washing out temporary hair color will depend on the product you use and if it is temporary or semi-permanent. Temporary hair dyes only weakly bind color to your hair cuticles, so it should come out with one to two regular washes and Wallace recommends using a clarifying shampoo. Semi-permanent dyes, on the other hand, may take a number of washes to fully come out. It is best to follow your specific product's washing instructions.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekmrqxu9GaqbJlmJa2s3nCqKOoql2ptrG%2FjKCsopyV</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
