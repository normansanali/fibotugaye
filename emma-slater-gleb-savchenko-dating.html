Are Emma Slater and Gleb Savchenko a couple? One thing is for sure, fans are very much invested in Emma Slater‚Äôs love life.</p><h3>Are Emma Slater and Gleb Savchenko dating from Dancing With the Stars?</h3><p>Slater and Gleb Savchenko made fans of the show stand up and pay attention when they recently hung out together in Las Vegas. The reunion in Sin City wasn‚Äôt casual for the two longtime Dancing with the Stars pros. Slater was there to support Savchenko, who was the guest host for the Chippendales, alongside Ezra Sosa and Britt Stewart.</p><p><strong>More</strong><strong>: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Who‚Äôs Coming Back For Dancing With the Stars Season 33?</a></p><p>Slater also posted about her support of Savchenko on Instagram, alongside some pictures of her and the two of them hanging out by the pool. There was nothing inherently romantic in the post, in hanging out by the pool together, or in the fact that she was there to support a friend, but the internet is the way it is and as soon as the post went up, speculation started.</p><p>‚ÄúAnyone else been kinda low key shipping Emma and Gleb? Lol,‚Äù one fan commented on the post. ‚ÄúI feel a spark there üëÄ,‚Äù another fan wrote. A third chimed in: ‚ÄúYou two have an amazing chemistry.‚Äù</p><p>The rumored Slater and Savchenko romance isn‚Äôt the first rumored romance for Slater in the past few months. Slater was recently linked to <a href=# rel=noopener>another Dancing With the Stars pro, Alan Bersten</a>. There was never any confirmation from either Slater or Bersten that the romance was indeed real, but it seems the internet has now moved on to link Slater with Savchenko.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More</strong>: The soap actors we want on Dancing With the Stars</a></p><p>Slater, who joined Dancing With the Stars in Season 17, was previously married to another pro, Sasha Farber. <a href=# rel=noopener>The two divorced in 2023</a>, with Slater confirming in an episode of Nick Viall‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Viall Files</a>&nbsp;podcast in August 2023 that the reason for the divorce was that she didn‚Äôt want to have kids yet. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to delay Sasha‚Äôs path in having kids because I know that he is ready for that,‚Äù she told Viall.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More: </strong>Where former Dancing With the Stars pros are now</a></p><p>The answer to the question of whether Slater and Savchenko are dating is just as murky as the answer to the question of whether Slater and Bersten were ever dating. We don‚Äôt know. But we are likely to find out either way in the months ahead because when things work out, it‚Äôs hard to keep them secret.</p><p>Dancing With the Stars&nbsp;is available to stream on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Plus</a>.</p><p>Who is dating who on Dancing with the Stars? <strong>Check out the below photo gallery to find out the real-life partners of the <a href=# rel=noopener>hosts of Dancing With the Stars</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2iBcoOOnqSmmV2ouaLAxKtkoKSVl3q0rdWcn56mm6R6pa3ToqWgZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
