Aside from it, he earns from other various sources as well.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_From_YouTube></span>Earnings From YouTube<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Hikaru Nakamura is an active YouTube user. He has a YouTube channel named ‘<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">GMHikaru</a>,’ which currently has a total of 1 million subscribers. On top of that, he seems to operate two more YouTube channels, GM Hikaru Clips, with 16.2K subscribers, and More GMHikaru, with 83.4K subscribers. In all three of his YouTube channels, Nakamura uploads videos of playing odd games against his viewers and some tips and tricks for young chess players.</p><p>According to Social Blade, Hikaru’s main YouTube channel, GMHikaru’s monthly estimated earnings ranges between $3K – $48.7K and yearly estimated earnings ranges between $36.6K – $585K. Moreover, he receives thousands of dollars as revenue through his other YouTube channels as well.<br></p><br>Furthermore, Hikaru Nakamura is also an active Twitch live streamer. His Twitch channel currently has 1.2M followers. Nakamura plays speed chess games against various grandmasters, other streamers, and viewers who pay to subscribe to his channel.<p>Similarly, he maintains a successful social media presence in other social networking handles as well. At present, his Twitter has 321.7K followers, while his Instagram bears 196K followers. Also, Nakamura uses a Discord server named ‘Naka’s PogUniversity.’</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Earnings_From_Other_Sources></span>Earnings From Other Sources<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Besides earning from several chess tournaments and from coaching chess online and in person, Nakamura earns from other sources as well. He is an author of a book named ‘Bullet Chess: One Minute To Mate.’ Currently, the price of his book on Amazon is $8.69 for its Kindle edition and $19.95 for Paperback.</p><p>Moreover, he saves a lot of money by being sponsored by different companies. In the past, Hikaru Nakamura was the only chess player endorsed by the Red Bull Company. Lately, Chess.com, a chess website, was his sponsor. Recently, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">he signed</a> with the esports organization TSM (Team SoloMid) for a six-figure sum.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Lets goooo! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8dVzpixSc1</a></p><p>— Hikaru Nakamura (@GMHikaru) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">August 29, 2020</a></p><p><br>Furthermore, Nakamura made a cameo appearance as himself in season 5, episode 2 of the Showtime T.V. series Billions in 2020. The episode’s title is ‘The Chris Rock Test,’ where Nakamura gave the simul for a minute. It was a part of the fundraiser taking place during the episode.</p><p>In this way, Hikaru Nakamura’s net worth is rising with his increasing fame as a chess player and Twitch streamer of chess games. Plus, his involvement in other fields also has helped him to draw money to his total assets.</p><p>However, still, it does not seem like all of Hikaru Nakamura’s earnings, as mentioned above, totals up to $50 million. Nakamura himself told in one of his YouTube videos in 2020 that he has far less money than $45 million. He added that he would be streaming for free if he had such a big sum of money. So, Hikaru Nakamura’s net worth might be far less than $50 million. But, we hope he will amass a similar amount in a few years from now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Involved_In_Philanthropic_Works></span>Involved In Philanthropic Works<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hikaru Nakamura might not have billions of dollars in his pocket, but he has a philanthropic heart, which is beyond price. In October 2020, he organized a 77 board charity simultaneous exhibition online and raised around $9,500 for Doctors Without Borders.</p><p>Also, before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, Nakamura challenged former President Barack Obama to a chess game to raise funds for then-nominee Joe Biden’s victory and Act Blue. Recently, he and his team conducted a charity stream after losing in the quarterfinals to Levon Aronian in the Champions Chess Tour 2021. They raised over $352K for a major international humanitarian agency named CARE’s fight against hunger.</p><p>Though Hikaru Nakamura might not have a net worth of $50 million, he, without any doubt, is rich by heart.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Trivia></span>Trivia<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Hikaru Nakamura was born in Hirakata, Osaka Prefecture, Japan, on December 9, 1987, to an American mother and a Japanese father.</li><li>Nakamura has an older brother named <strong>Asuka Nakamura</strong>.</li><li>He is in a relationship with an Italian chess player, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Maria De Rosa</strong></a>.</li><li>He is a keen runner and tennis player.</li><li>Hikaru took training from the legendary chess grandmaster, <strong>Garry Kasparov</strong>, for a year in 2011.</li></ul><p>For more updates on&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Entertainment</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>Celebrity Babies</strong></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><i><strong>YouTubers</strong></i></a>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Movies & TV Series</a>,</strong>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<i><strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebrityMirror</a>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeinrCpsdKtZJydnJqvs7XTopysZ5ieuKK%2B1GalmqORosKzrYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
