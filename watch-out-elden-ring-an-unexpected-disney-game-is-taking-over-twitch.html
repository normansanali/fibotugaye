Not surprising in and of itself since the game has just come out and there’s a lot of hype to go along with it, but the game must have really impressed audiences and streamers alike to rope in such impressive numbers.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=836 data-injectable=false>Disney’s sim might continue to ride this wave for a few more days, in which case it could easily overtake Temtem and The Last of Us Part II, the two games that are next on the list. In fact, at the rate this game has managed to go viral, we wouldn’t be surprised if it soon became an internet sensation of Animal Crossing: New Horizons proportions, the Nintendo game that singlehandedly saved everyone from depression at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZorpqsk516sMHTZpylnJWjerO1zaBkmqZdqrumxM%2Bemq2dlGKxqr%2FNnrBmn5Gism610marmqOZo7Ruu9WeqWasp57BpLSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
