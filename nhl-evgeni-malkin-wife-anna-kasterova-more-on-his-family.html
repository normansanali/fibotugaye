On the day of the murder, her boyfriend dropped her off.</p><p>She did not, however, show up for work the next day. A coworker came to check on her but received no response.</p><p>Knellâ€™s boyfriend Ian Plass, who has died since the time of the killing, also came to her apartment. When he received no answer, he went around to the back of the building and got in through the window onto the flat.</p><p>There, he found Knell naked and dead under the quilt on her bed. She was sexually abused at the time of or after she was dead.</p><p>Five months later, Fuller abducted Carolina Pierce from outside her house. Neighbors had heard screaming of a woman but were unaware of her missing.</p><p>Three weeks later, the police found her naked body 38 miles away from her house floating at Honeychild Farm.</p><p>The police managed to locate Fuller due to the modern technology that made it possible to compare the DNA samples obtained from the bodies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toppiheqbCxp6lomWdlrmstc1mrqKelWKur7rAZqKaq6Sav7DCwGakqKqVYryveceiqmaekaK2rcWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
