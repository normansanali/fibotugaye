At the time she was the <a href=#>plus-one</a> of her then-husband, Kanye West, who was performing at the event. Kardashian was also pregnant with their first child, daughter <a href=#>North</a>. (The exes, who were married from 2014 to 2022, also share daughter <a href=#>Chicago</a> and sons <a href=#>Saint</a> and <a href=#>Psalm</a>.)</p><p>To go along with the 2013 theme, “Punk: Chaos to Couture,” the Skims founder donned a bold floral long-sleeved and high-neck gown with a thigh-high split created by <a href=#><strong>Riccardo Tisci</strong></a> for <a href=#>Givenchy</a>. The designer opted for a stretchy, breathable fabric so Kardashian would remain comfortable with her growing bump.</p><p>As she walked the red carpet, social media users thought the dress looked similarly to the one <a href=#>Robin Williams</a> sported in his 1993 film, <a href=#>Mrs. Doubtfire</a>. Following her appearance, <a href=#>memes began to circulate</a> that compared the two looks side-by-side. At the time, the late comedian quipped, “I think I wore it better!”</p><p>While strolling down memory lane of some of her best fashion looks with <a href=#>Vogue</a> in November 2019, Kardashian confessed she was “<a href=#>crying</a> the whole way home” after learning what the public thought of her outfit.</p><p>“I think Robin Williams even tweeted it, [he] said I looked like Mrs. Doubtfire. It was like this whole thing, so I just cried,” she recalled in the clip. “And now I love [the dress], like, now it’s sick. I look back and I’m like ‘Wow, they had the vision.’”</p><p>Following her first Met debacle, the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> alum began to <a href=#>elevate her style</a> as she opted for more sultry garments. In 2015, the reality star channeled her inner <a href=#><strong>Cher</strong></a> as she glowed in a<strong> Roberto Cavalli</strong> original. The designer used sheer crystal embroidery and feather detailing for the to create the stunning white gown with a lengthy train.</p><p>As Kardashian became a regular attendee of the New York City soirée, she opted for bolder — and even <a href=#>controversial</a> — selections. In 2022, the Selfish author <a href=#>faced backlash</a> after she borrowed <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a>’s famous <a href=#>Jean Louis gown</a> for the spectacle. The historical slip dress, which the iconic movie star wore when she sang “Happy Birthday” to <a href=#>President John F. Kennedy</a> in 1962, was loaned to Kardashian by Ripley’s Believe It or Not! for the occasion. The TV personality went on a <a href=#>strict diet</a> to ensure the dress would fit, losing 16 lbs in three weeks.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following the event, Kardashian was <a href=#>accused of damaging the item</a> upon its return to the museum. However, both Ripley and KKW Beauty founder <a href=#>refuted the accusations</a> that the dress had additional rips and tears.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Kardashian’s Met Gala looks over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKoqRmo5GnsaK%2Fx6KYp6tdorK1ecaao5plo6nGrbGMnq2opKWptrC6jKitnqpdqbWmediemKurXaW2pL%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
