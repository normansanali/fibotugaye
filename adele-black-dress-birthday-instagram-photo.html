She shared a photo of her at-home fete, which included a whole photo installation in her driveway. (Adele's Instagram game does not slow down while she's social distancing!) Her party look consisted of a puff-sleeve frock, pointed-toe pumps, and an assortment of gold rings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Thank you for the birthday love. I hope you're all staying safe and sane during this crazy time," Adele captioned the photo before adding a shout-out to those working on the front lines of the current medical crisis. "I'd like to thank all of our first responders and essential workers who are keeping us safe while risking their lives!
