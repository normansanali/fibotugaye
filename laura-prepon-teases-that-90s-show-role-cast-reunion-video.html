It’s all the same sets,” the <a href=#>PrepOn Kitchen founde</a>r, 42, exclusively teased to&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>on Wednesday, June 15, of the new series while discussing her partnership with <a href=#>Vitalite</a>. “When I first went there, I cried. I’m just like, ‘<a href=#>The nostalgia is so strong</a> and it was such an incredible time in my life.’ I can’t wait for people to see it. I think they’re really, really gonna get a kick out of it.”</p><p class=p1>Prepon rose to fame playing Donna — opposite <a href=#><strong>Topher Grace</strong></a>’s Eric Forman — on the FOX series upon its 1999 premiere. Helmed by <a href=#><strong>Mark Brazill</strong></a>,<a href=#>&nbsp;<strong>Bonnie Turner</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Terry Turner</strong></a>,&nbsp;<i>That ’70s Show&nbsp;</i>followed<a href=#> a group of teenagers coming of age in the Wisconsin suburbs</a> during the 1970s. <a href=#><strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Mila Kunis</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Wilmer Valderrama</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Danny Masterson</strong></a>, <strong>Debra Jo Rupp</strong> and <strong>Kurtwood Smith</strong> also starred.</p><p class=p1>Netflix announced in October 2021 that <a href=#>they had picked up a revival series</a> starring Rupp, 71, and Smith, 78, who’d reprise their roles as Eric’s parents: Kitty and Red Forman. The new series will see the Formans babysitting Eric and Donna’s daughter, Leia (<strong>Callie Haverda</strong>), while she is visiting for the summer. It was confirmed earlier this year that Prepon and her TV love interest, 43, would both return for the new series. The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Bad Moms</a>&nbsp;</i>star, 38, Kutcher, 44, and Valderrama, 42, are also set to recur though further details have yet to be revealed.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Orange Is The New Black</a>&nbsp;</i>alum, for her part, revealed to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that “oddly” it has not been “weird” t<a href=#>o step back into Donna’s shoes</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Donna-Back-Why-Laura-Prepon-Cried-During-1st-That-90s-Show-Appearance-0001.jpg><p class=p1>“It just was like the nostalgia of it,” Prepon — who married actor <a href=#><strong>Ben Foster</strong></a> in 2018 — explained on Wednesday, noting she has remained close to her former costars after they spent much of their “formative years” together. “You don’t realize like, it’s still, like, if I hear <strong>Todd Rundgren</strong>’s [song] ‘Hello, It’s Me,’ I <a href=#>burst into tears ‘cause that’s the pilot song</a>, you know, that was like the Eric and Donna [theme song and] it was a really pinnacle song for that relationship, but yeah, it’s great [to return].”</p><p class=p1>In addition to reprising her beloved TV role <a href=#>for the upcoming Netflix revival</a>, Prepon has teamed up with Vitalite to <a href=#>incorporate plant-based foods into family-friendly meals</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I consider <a href=#>myself more of a flexitarian lifestyle</a> especially when it gets toward like the hotter months. I definitely tend to go more plant-based for my family and partnering with a company like Vitalite is great, [because] I use it at home and my kids eat it and love it,” the actress — who <a href=#>shares a son and a daughter with the 41-year-old&nbsp;<i>Hell Or High Water</i>&nbsp;star</a> — said. “It’s just like a really great fit. So, it’s exciting.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>She added: “[Health and cooking] something that I focus on a lot. I mean, <a href=#>my first cookbook came out in 2016</a> and that was all about batch-cooking healthy meals and then reimagining it for three days after that. … I mean a lot of my videos that I post [are] usually about cooking quick and healthy meals for your family, with an emphasis on preparation, because as a career mom it is harder to get healthy meals on the table — but it’s all about having the right ingredients. So this partnership really helps make that a lot easier, especially with picky kiddo eaters.”</p><p class=p1><i>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOaraKWerG%2BxKmmp2Wkmq60sdJmq6GZpGKGcb%2BMrJ%2Bor12nvK2xjJyYrKxdp7K2usiopWaumZmysHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
