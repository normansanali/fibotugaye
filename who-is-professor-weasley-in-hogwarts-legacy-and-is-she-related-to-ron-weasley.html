Marrying the old and new, this open-world role playing game looks to write a unique chapter in the Potterverse story — all while trying to stay true to the franchise’s magical source material.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>Set in the 1800s, Hogwarts Legacy takes place long before the boy who lived defeated he who must not be named. Yet one name in particular has plenty of fans asking questions, and it’s a name we know all too well: Weasley.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>That’s right, a Weasley is back at Hogwarts. Not any old Weasley either, a PROFESSOR Weasley. We’re officially freaking out.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>It seems as though no good Hogwarts story is complete without the addition of this iconic family, and Professor Matilde Weasley is shaping up to be one of the most important characters in Hogwarts Legacy. Serving as Deputy Headmistress (to Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black, another familiar face), Matilde Weasley will aid players on their journey throughout the game’s story.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>As Deputy, her duties include aiding the headmaster and carrying out some of the more boring goings on at Hogwarts. Matilde also serves as the schools Transfiguration professor, meaning her specialty comes by way of changing one object into another — with magic of course. Casting spells, managing mischief, and all that good stuff.</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>So how is Matilde Weasley related to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ronald Weasley</a>, if at all? Well, this is where things aren’t as clear. As it stand, no one seems to know exactly how Matilde is related to Ron. Perhaps she exists as a great-great-aunt, or distant relative of some sort, but with no hard evidence out to support that claim, your guess is as good as ours. Here’s hoping that the game provides an easter egg, clue, or outright confirmation of their distant relationship.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Regardless of how she’s related to Ron, Matilde Weasley is quickly becoming one of Hogwarts Legacy’s most popular characters. Only time will tell how in-depth her involvement in the story actually becomes, but thankfully, we won’t have to wait much longer to find out.</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=false>This is the game fans have been asking for, for decades, and now that it’s finally here there’s only one thing left to do.
