When faced with the inevitable question of whether he’ll pull a Tennant and hop in the TARDIS again, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Capaldi has surprisingly vowed</a> that we won’t be seeing him in any future multi-Doctor crossovers as he has no interest in “digging” up his old role as the Twelfth Doctor.

This tells us that Yoda’s kind don’t actually have to speak backward, after all, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> is having a field day over this hilarious fact, as it means that Yoda has just been trolling everyone for the past 900 years.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Wait, who was that Inquisitor in Tales of the Jedi?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/the-sixth-brother-star-wars-tales-of-the-jedi.png><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=846 data-injectable=true>Staying with Tales of the Jedi for a moment, the animated miniseries’ finale offers a glimpse at what Ahsoka did in the wake of Order 66, featuring her battling an Inquisitor on her trail. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">But which Inquisitor is it?</a> Fans initially assumed it was the Sixth Brother, introduced in 2016’s Ahsoka novel, due to a certain resemblance between the two characters, but this would wipe that story from canon. It’s vaguely possible they are one and the same, but it’s more likely this is an Inquisitor we’ve never met before.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is Cloud Atlas a gift from above or a map to misery?

However, the term is entirely accurate when it comes to the Wachowskis’ Cloud Atlas, the eons-spanning sci-fi epic that’s now a full decade old, and yet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the movie-loving community still cannot agree</a> on whether it’s an underrated masterpiece of unconventional cinema or if it’s just a turgid, poorly executed mess.
