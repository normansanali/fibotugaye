Luckily, they are given to you pretty early on in the game. Of course, as the game progresses you will need more of this life elixir to keep yourself going. This guide will show you how to make more health potions in Hogwarts Legacy.</p><h2>How to craft Wiggenweld Potions in Hogwarts Legacy</h2><p data-injection=true>Close to the start of the game, you will encounter your first bit of combat. Before that, however, you will receive a few health potions. These potions, also known as Wiggenweld Potions, are meant to restore your health in the event that you get injured by enemies or you happen to fall down a cliff and take some damage.
