He then opened fire on his mother, Tyesha Hall, his 21-year-old sister, and his 12-year-old brother inside the house.

His family members were taken to VCU Medical Critical Care for treatment of their life-threatening injuries and are said to be recovering.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/157f9d45-0999-417f-a646-e6808ce69c51.png><p>His ‘Be Free’ music video was published while the manhunt was still active. According to sources, the graphics were pre-released and have since received over 43K views on YouTube. Authorities discovered EGYPXN in Rutherford County, North California, on Thursday, March 30. He was shot dead in the ensuing gunfight. During the standoff, a police officer was also hurt.</p><h2 class=split>'My last request from humanity'</h2><p>Just one day before his death, the rapper sent a message on Instagram with his "last request." He wrote, "My last request from humanity is that you seriously evaluate the care you have for each other. If this species is to ever evolve you must stop eating animals, stop warring with each other and take care of mother earth." He continued, "Overthrow this sadistic government and rebuild. On a fresh foundation. It’s time for me to rest now."</p><p>The reason for the violence is still unknown, according to a family friend, Tamara Harris, who stated, "To my knowledge, there were no issues that would have led to such a tragic event." According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AceShowBiz</a>, another family friend, Roneece Walker-Jewett, weighed in on the tragedy and said, "I didn't believe them, and I called [Tyesha's] ex-husband, and he actually got on the scene. I can hear the paramedics in the background saying (...) 'female, two shots to the chest.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpGlvaa%2BjJ6esqioo3qzscuemKydlGK6tr%2FInGSvoZSavG7Ax55knZmpYrWmec6pnKedlGKzqr7EZpitZZ2kurR5x6iknmWUlsa0ecGenaiqlWKvprXNoGSgrZ6jsqV5w6iupw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
