The show features two sisters Kirsten Meehan and <a href=#>Lindsey Uselding</a> as they embark on a quest to fix property disasters in Minneapolis. Or as HGTV puts it, “helping clients see past the distress to create a totally transformed better-than-before dream home.”</span></p><p><span>Overall, the series will consist of eight episodes where the sisters rebuild a home destroyed by a raging fire, investigate a house left with a gaping hole from a car crash, save a client’s home from a flooding disaster, and tackle a hail storm that hits Lindsey’s own home, and much more.</span></p><p><i><span>Renovation 911</span></i><span> premiered on March 28, 2023. But Kirsten announced the news a year before on her IG post, captioned, “Big news, it’s official, THIS is happening!? @lindsey.uselding and I are going to be on TV!!!

Can’t. She. Do.”</span></p><p><span>Personally, Kirsten loves sharing savvy design solutions anyone can replicate. “My design philosophy centers on the beauty of functionality and empowering the self-starter in you,” she said. The star also added that though her job stresses her to no end, she really loves it. “One of the best parts is when friends put their faith in me. When they buy an old place and together we find the potential and shine it up,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Find&nbsp; </span><i><span>Practical Home</span></i><span> on IG @</span><a href=#><span>practicalhomeofficial</span></a><span>.
