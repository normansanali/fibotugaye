The annual White House Correspondents’ Dinner is almost upon Us and some of the biggest names in Hollywood and government are expected to attend.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This year’s soirée is set to take place on Saturday, April 29, at the Washington Hilton in Washington, D.C. As expected, <a href=#><strong>President Joe Biden</strong></a> and first lady<a href=#> Jill Biden</a> are scheduled to appear at the glitzy event, which is held to support the work of journalists as well as provide scholarships for the next generation of storytellers. Along with the president, <a href=#><strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong></a> and her husband, second gentleman <strong>Douglass Emhoff</strong>, will be in attendance.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Additional guests include <a href=#><strong>John Legend</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a>, per <a href=#>Deadline</a>. <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>’ <a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> plan to enjoy the evening as guests of DailyMail.com, <a href=#>the publication announced</a> on Monday, April 24.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The ceremony comes after 37-year-old Madix’s very public split with longtime boyfriend Tom Sandoval, who <a href=#>cheated on her</a> with their Pump Rules costar, <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>. “I’m so thrilled and honored to be invited by DailyMail.com,” Madix said in a statement to the outlet. “I watch the dinner on TV every year and have always dreamed of being there in person.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Vanderpump, 62, echoed similar sentiments. “I don’t know what’s more complicated, reality television or politics — I guess I’ll find out on Saturday evening,” she joked. “I’m delighted to be attending this year’s White House Correspondents Association dinner.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Daily Show correspondent <strong>Roy Wood Jr.</strong> will host the gathering, cracking jokes with audience members after President Biden’s standup segment. Traditionally, current presidents take the stage during the event with humorous one-liners. When President <strong><a href=#>Donald Trump</a></strong> was in office, however, he opted to skip the dinners.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Wood, 44, hinted about who he’ll target with his jokes during the night, telling <a href=#>CNN</a> in a Friday, April 28, interview, “I’ve got to talk about everything this week. There was a lot of stuff that happened this week. Many things that happened this week, and those things have to be discussed in a fair way, in a very way.”&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He added: “Trust me, I’m not [going] to lose my job. I’m not trying to get in trouble. OK, that’s the most important part of the correspondents’ dinner: Leave employed.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Last year’s festivity was hosted by <a href=#><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></a> and attended by <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>.
