He is in a marital relationship with a real estate agent, <strong>Katya Suh,</strong> whom he met during his college days. Suh publicly announced his relationship with Katya for the first time only on 19 January 2019. And, now, the husband-wife duo is expecting their first kids as well.

However, Ndamukong Suh‚Äôs wife, Katya, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">posted</a> her first photo with Suh on her Instagram many months before that on 1 June 2018.</p><p>Ndamukong Suh met his future wife, Katya, while they were studying at the University of Nebraska in 2009 and remained close ever since. Eventually, they decided to move in together in 2018 and got engaged in the spring of 2019 while they were on vacation in France.
