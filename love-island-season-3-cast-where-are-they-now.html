Airing in the summer of 2021, the season had a total of 34 contestants. The episodes were often unpredictable, with many surprising couples emerging. But in the end, couple Olivia Kaiser and Korey Gandy emerged victorious.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>You may remember that season 2 in 2020 was forced to abandon the normal island setting due to pandemic travel restrictions, and instead, the season was located in a bio-secure villa atop a Vegas hotel. Lucky for the season 3 islanders, the show returned to form by setting the villa on the island of Hawaii. Season 3 was also the last to air on CBS, before the franchise moved to streamer Peacock.</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=912 data-injectable=true>Another key trait set season 3 apart from the prior two seasons. In advance of casting the show, CBS announced a new diversity initiative, mandating that for&nbsp;Love Island&nbsp;and other CBS reality shows, 50% of all contestants must be a Person of Color or an Indigenous person for the 2021–2022 broadcast season. The network hired Ally Capriotti Grant, an Emmy Award-winning casting director whose prior credits include&nbsp;Queer Eye, to lead the casting efforts for&nbsp;Love Island‘s third season.</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>After a long season of romance and heartbreak, Olivia Kaiser and Korey Gandy won the show and the $100,000 prize. But are they still together? Are any of the top four couples?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Olivia Kaiser and Korey Gandy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Oliva-and-Korey-on-Love-Island-USA.jpg><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Then-28-year-old Olivia Kaiser was a cosmetologist from Alaska, living in Arizona. In the early days of the season, Olivia was coupled with&nbsp;Javonny Vega. However, she dumped him on day 17 and returned to the villa post-break-up. By day 29, Olivia coupled up with Korey, a former Enterprise branch manager from Virginia Beach. Korey received the most public votes to win the prize, which he then generously chose to split with his partner, Olivia.</p><p data-characters=749 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>However, Olivia and Korey broke up within just a few months of the show ending. Korey announced the break-up on Instagram, writing: “When we were on Love Island everything was perfect and I can say that was honestly the happiest moment of my life. Unfortunately, that’s not real life and in the real world we’re now faced with real-world challenges, some that we couldn’t overcome. We went through this experience together and no one can ever take that away from us. This girl is seriously one of the most beautiful people I’ve ever met inside and out. I will always respect her and care for her.” It’s a real bummer that they broke up, but you’ve got to hand it to Korey that his statement about Olivia is pretty classy.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>Nowadays, Olivia is back in Arizona most of the time, although she sometimes travels for reality TV work. She was recently featured in The Challenge, and was even a finalist. Olivia has her own beauty company,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">livbeautifullyaz</a>, where she offers services like micro-blading and permanent eyeliner.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>Korey is back in Virginia Beach, working as an influencer.

It was hard to stay together after the series wrapped, with Kyra being from Hawaii and Will from the country of Colombia.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>The couple broke up shortly after filming, but in a turn of events, they reunited recently!

Following the dumping of Cinco Holland&nbsp;and Genevieve Shacross, three new women joined the villa. One of those women was Bailey, a then 23-year-old from Portland, Oregon who had recently graduated from the University of Arizona, where she was part of the Alpha Phi sorority. Bailey turned multiple men’s heads, including Korey Gandy and Jeremy Hershberg. Unfortunately for Korey, he was already involved with Olivia, and she ended up coupling with personal trainer Jeremy. The couple finished the show in third place, but did not stay together long after the finale.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>Bailey still lives in Portland, where she works as a model and influencer.
