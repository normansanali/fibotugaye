Carving out an impressive career in the heavyweight division, Browne's prowess in the Octagon has earned him a loyal following among fans of the sport. Jumpstarting&nbsp;his professional career in 2009, Browne signed with the UFC in 2015. Quickly making a name by winning his first consecutive nine bouts,&nbsp;he&nbsp;only lost one of his first 18 professional matches.&nbsp;A serious title contender at one point,&nbsp;Browne was listed at no. 5 in June 2015's official UFC Heavyweight rankings. Upon retiring in 2018,&nbsp;Browne's record stood at 18 wins and 7 losses,&nbsp;with his last win being in January 2016 against Matt Mitrione.</p><p dir=ltr>Just as he is her source of constant support and comfort, Rousey is her husband's biggest fan. "My personal life is better than it's ever been," Browne told Hawaii's <a href=#>Star-Advertiser</a>&nbsp;amid a series of defeats in 2017. "Being with somebody who understands the game, being with somebody who's there to support you as a partner in life instead of being that person who draws that energy out of you ... I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for that," Browne credited Rousey. The power couple also avoided competitiveness in their relationship.&nbsp;"That's one thing we set up early on," Browne said. "She [has] her own work. That's her baby. What I do is my baby."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhZ4N1f46rpqeckWK%2FsMHSnrBmoKWor6K6w2arq5mmnsBurtGorqedXZ%2B8o3nDqJysZZakv264yK%2Bgp59f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
