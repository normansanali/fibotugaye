Lowell Thompson and Luritha (Snyder) Thompson, who have now passed away, were her parents when she was born on May 14, 1956 in Columbus, Indiana. On November 11, 1974, in Edinburgh, Indiana, Jane tied the knot with her cherished husband Bradley “Ernie” Scott, and the couple went on to enjoy almost half a century of intimate love and companionship together.<br>It was in 2015 that Jane retired from her position as a Postal Clerk at the Crothersville Post Office, after having served the United States Postal Service for a significant number of years. Her generosity, infinite love for her family and friends, and kindhearted demeanor earned her a reputation for being a remarkable person. Jane’s kind nature and kind heart left an indelible mark on the lives of everyone who knew her.<br>When Jane had some free time, she found happiness in the simplest of pleasures. She enjoyed spending time outside observing the birds, crocheting blankets for her family, and going mushroom hunting with Ernie, even when it was not mushroom season. She also enjoyed spending time with her family. It was more about Jane and Ernie enjoying each other’s company in the vast outdoors than it was about anything else. She had a deep affection for her grandkids and always treasured the time she got to spend with them and their pets.<br>Jane is survived by her devoted husband, Bradley “Ernie” Scott, who resides in Scottsburg, Indiana; her devoted children, Gretchen Rose (Neal) of Seymour, Indiana, Martin Scott (Kristen) of Scottsburg, Indiana, and Rebecca Ridings (Brian) of Jeffersonville, Indiana; her adoring grandsons, Nicholas Sowder (Katie) of Seymour, Indiana, and Jared Scott (Ilana) of Scottsburg, Indiana; and her three great-grandchildren, Hunter, Lainey, and RaeMarie.<br>She was preceded in death by her siblings, Daniel Thompson, Tim Thompson, Nancy Nye, and Robert Thompson, in addition to her parents. Jane was the only surviving member of her family. On Thursday, February 15, 2024, at four o’clock in the afternoon, Adams Family Funeral Homes & Crematory will be the location of a funeral ceremony with the purpose of commemorating the life of Jane. During the same day, family and friends are welcome to offer their respects beginning at 2:00 PM and continuing until the time of the service. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be sent to the Crothersville Food Pantry or Mental Health America of Indiana.
