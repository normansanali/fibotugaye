Not just something that will momentarily cover up a blemish for an immediate wow effect, but something that masks and stays put.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It doesn't seem for a lot to ask for in a color cosmetic, but yet, I've gone through so many concealers that have fallen short. I've found several that have worked decently well throughout the years (typically, they're creamy formulas that melt into the skin) but none have left as strong an impression as Clé de Peau's Concealer has.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At $75 a pop, it's hardly a steal. However, there's a reason why celebrities such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Chrissy Teigen</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Jennifer Anniston</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Nicole Kidman</a> use it. The full-coverage formula looks like it will feel heavy on the skin, but it's surprisingly lightweight. Plus, it's filled with more than a handful of skincare ingredients that work to treat the skin while acting as a color cosmetic. As if that weren't enough, it has SPF 27, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The formula feels soft and creamy upon touch. When applied to the face, it covers every imperfection while blending seamlessly into the rest of your makeup or natural skin. It makes your skin look like it's been airbrushed — truly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, as previously mentioned, it has a ton of skin-healthy ingredients in it. For example, it features plumping hyaluronic acid, nourishing Argan, and protective chestnut rose fruit extract.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I personally love it so much, but it's also an InStyle tried-and-true product that has stood the test of time. In fact, it's won 15 InStyle beauty awards. Yes, that's how good it is.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop:</strong> $75; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>cledepeaubeaute.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Clé de Peau concealer comes in 12 adaptable shades ranging from ivory to espresso. As someone with medium-toned skin with neutral undertones, I use the shade "honey" and have been known to contour my face with a concealer that's one to two shades darker than my natural one. The results always look incredibly natural.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And yes, we know it's on the expensive-side of concealers on the market, but the high price is justified in the quality of the ingredients and the color payoff and durability. I love knowing that once I cover my under-eye circles in the morning, I won't catch my reflection in the mirror halfway through the day and wonder why I look so tired. Similarly, I know that any post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation will remain masked until I wash my face at night. That peace of mind is worth every cent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Splurge</a>&nbsp;is our recurring column dedicated to expensive beauty products that are worth it.
