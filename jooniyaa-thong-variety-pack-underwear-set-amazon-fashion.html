Happy shopping!</p><p>It’s true: We like to keep our wardrobes updated to reflect the hottest fashion trends — but when it comes to our underwear, we’re simply not paying attention to the latest and greatest on the market. Chances are, you’re similar to Us — in which case, it may be high time to ditch your old undies and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">replace them with some fresh new options</a>!</p><p>Here’s the thing — quality underwear isn’t always cheap. If you’re hoping to do a complete purge of all your undergarments, you’ll likely run up a budget-busting intimates bill. That’s one of many reasons why shoppers hold onto their skivvies long past their expiration date, but luckily, we found an alternative (and affordable) way to solve this problem. Thanks to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">this set</a>, you can get up to 20 pairs for under $30 — that’s less than $2 each!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jooniyaa-Women-Variety-of-Underwear-Pack-T-Back-Thong-G-String-Panties-2.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Jooniyaa’s Women Variety of Underwear Pack T-Back Thong G-String Panties</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$20</a>, available on Amazon!

There are two sizes — a 10-pack and a 20-pack — and the prices are truly hard to believe. Best of all, the quality of these panties is next-level! Shopper after shopper admits to being endlessly impressed with these sets. One self-described “Victoria’s Secret snob” even said they are obsessed <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">with every single pair</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jooniyaa-Women-Variety-of-Underwear-Pack-T-Back-Thong-G-String-Panties.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Jooniyaa’s Women Variety of Underwear Pack T-Back Thong G-String Panties</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$20</a>, available on Amazon!

The only caveat? Well, there’s an emphasis on variety here — you can’t choose which colors arrive to your doorstep.
