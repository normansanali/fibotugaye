Here’s what they all said:</p><p><strong>Madison</strong>: “It’ll be a really cool dynamic to see, because the Pogues is kind of an abstract idea anyway, it’s a very broad group of people. The Outer Banks Pogues have really been established, and it’s really going to be cool to see what are Pogues like in other places, and wow, we really have so much in common. Now we’re meeting Pogues internationally, and that’s a cool dynamic. International Pogues!”</p><p><strong>Chase</strong>: “She has so many assets for the Pogues that so many of us wish we could do. It’ll be interesting to see where it goes. We kind of really don’t know her and we’ve embraced her pretty quickly in this group of the five of us, so what does this new dynamic bring? What does her background that we don’t know, how does that play into this next chapter? But I think she brings a lot of flair that throws them off, and I think it’s much needed for all the Pogues to see somebody who can put them in their position and keep them in their place. I’m excited.”</p><p><strong>Jonathan</strong>: “She does bring a fire and definitely a different type of street knowledge as a character who grew up in the Bahamas and is moving from place to place and exemplifies the Pogue life. You’re ready to start knowing more about her origins, what drives her, and the more you know about her, the more you sympathize with her. Her becoming part of the Pogues and adding to this dynamic, she fits that crazy, ‘I go head first, we’re all in this together’ [attitude].”</p><p><strong>Rudy</strong>: “Pogues are survivors, and we survive in the Outer Banks, but Cleo on the other hand survives anywhere. And I think that street knowledge like J.D. was talking about, that flair, that, ‘No, I know what do in this situation,’ she has kind of an upper hand in quite a bit of things [and] that brings an interesting twist to the Pogues. She’s going to kind of, I feel like, take charge. That’s where I see her going.”</p><p>Make sure to <a href=#>watch the season two trailer</a> if you missed it!</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Justjared.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6top6WpsrN5wZqlpKtdqMGivtJmq5qkm2Kuo7vUrWScpJWkwG6y1K2sq51dpLtuwMeeZKygn6x6orLTnqlmq5WWwLC6jGtkn6Gelrmmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
