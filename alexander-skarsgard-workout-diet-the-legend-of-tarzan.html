The interest in the film rose up several notches when people saw <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Alexander&nbsp;Skarsgard</a> showing off 8 pack abs in the trailer of the film. He was totally drenched in the rain for the trailer and looked super hot. His co-star <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Margot Robbie</a> who plays the role of Jane Porter also looked stunning as a redhead.</p><p>If you are also excited about the upcoming film The Legend of Tarzan, you might be interested in knowing how the Stockholm born changed his body for the film and what diet did he follow. Get all these answers right here.</p><h3><strong>The Nervousness</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Tarzan-and-Jane-Porter.jpg><p>The talented actor confessed that he took the&nbsp;help of a great trainer for the film. He also had a nutritionist to guide him in the journey of getting fitter reported <a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>ABC News</a>. He was nervous during&nbsp;the journey and body transformation as he didn’t do anything like this ever before. He was also skeptical about how his body would respond to the new training regime and the changed diet.</p><h3><strong>Workout Routine</strong></h3><p>As Tarzan is often seen swinging through the jungle in barely a loincloth, the movie star had to work hard and push his body to its extreme. He spent four months in training for the film and worked out a lot. He even got up at 4.30 in the morning to begin his training. He did not even see his family and friends for a long time while shooting the film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Alexander-Skarsgard-heading-towards-Equinox-gym-for-a-workout-in-LA.jpg><h3><strong>Working on the Posture</strong></h3><p>Skarsgård took help of the famous choreographer Wayne McGregor to decide his posture, <a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>USA Today</a> exclusively reported. He wanted to walk like a guy who pretends to be an upper-crust Englishman, but then gives in to embracing his wilder side after returning to his Congo home.</p><h3><strong>Diet Plan</strong></h3><p>The diet plan of the handsome hunk revolved around including loads of chicken cutlets. He followed a very strict diet for many months before the film to achieve the body he is showing off these days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Alexander-Skarsgard-on-Icon-magazine-s-January-2016-Issue.jpg><h3><strong>Cheat Day</strong></h3><p>Alex did get an opportunity to cheat one day when his trainer took him to an Italian restaurant in Notting Hill. The trainer allowed him to eat whatever he wanted. He had pasta, pizza and some tiramisu too. It was the best meal of the actor’s life.</p><h3><strong>The Result</strong></h3><p>The result of the dedication paid off nicely for the skilled actor. He is getting really popular because of his abs and people are really anticipating seeing him in the movie which releases on July 1, 2016.</p><h3><strong>Less Crazy Stuff</strong></h3><p>The True Blood (2008-2014) actor confessed that he didn’t do all the crazy stuff like swinging through the trees himself. He relied on an experienced trapeze artist for that. He usually did a few bits of the initial crazy stuff and had a coffee while the artist performed marvelously. Then he showed up when the landing was to be shot. (Well, that’s honest.)</p><h3><strong>The Overall Experience</strong></h3><p>The Zoolander (2001-Present) actor also termed shooting for the movie as an incredible experience. The shooting of the film lasted for 6 months and they were in London during the complete&nbsp;time. Alexander&nbsp;stayed away from his family and friends for a long period of time, but didn’t regret his decision as he loved the people he was working with as well as the script. The dashing actor also appreciated the director David Yates (who is famous for directing four Harry Potter&nbsp;films) and called him a genius for twisting the popular tale into something extraordinary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Alexander-Skarsgard-as-Tarzan.jpg><h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3><p>For those of you who can’t wait for the film until its&nbsp;release to know its story, the actor has something special. He talked to <a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Hitfix</a> about the story of the film. In this film, Tarzan or John Clayton would already have been living in England for a decade. He would be like a civilized Lord in Victorian England during the time of late 1880s. He is trying to accept the new life, but then he goes back to the jungle. That’s when the adventure begins and the story gets interesting. During the film, the versatile actor will try to tame the beast initially and then would&nbsp;let it free when he visits his birthplace.</p><p>Sounds interesting? Don’t forget to catch the film at a theatre near you this summer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqjnrCRo7Gmvoysopqqo5yus7CMsKaro5%2BqwW6wyJ6rZqyYmnqtscaepZ1ln5t6ta3Rs5inZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
