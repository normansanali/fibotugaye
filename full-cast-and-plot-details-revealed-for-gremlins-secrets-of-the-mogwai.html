This block, according to WarnerMedia, is the “ultimate entertainment destination for families.” The press release also said that “ACME Night&nbsp;will be reserved for families to sit down together, every Sunday beginning at 6:00 p.m. ET/PT for a lineup of library favorites and upcoming new originals.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=false>Directed by Joe Dante and written by Chris Columbus, 1984’s&nbsp;Gremlins&nbsp;quickly cemented itself as a cult-classic film thanks to its mixture of comedy, black humor, and horror. In 1990, a sequel film called&nbsp;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&nbsp;hit theaters. A third film has been long-rumored. However, there is no information or timeline for the project at the current time. In an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Comicbook</a>, Chris Columbus said, “I can only say we’re working on it. We’re working toward that goal, but we haven’t gotten there yet.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ynwculZJyZo6l6orrDZqelp6RisabAwKKjrGWimsOmrcuem2aen6d6qL7EpqOipqNiwKav0Z6rrGWfm3q1tMRmpKifp5a2cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
