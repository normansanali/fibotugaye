We take only mostly shaved guys. He should also focus on his diet to help him get a bit harder. He doesn't have to go the fitness-y hard look, but he could tighten up a little bit. His body is a little soft. But he has good hair and a great face. He's definitely Chippendales material. Anytime he wants to do the show, he's more than welcome!"</p><p><strong>Playgirl writer Jamye Waxman</strong>:<br>"As a woman, I think the shots are tasteful, but of course, I would have loved to have seen it all! I think it's hard to get a 19-year-old to do 'sexy' and really get it. At 19, you know how to show off your still-tight body, but do you actually know how to use your sexuality? I feel like you really develop your sexual energy and attitude in your 20s and 30s, so Levi has a way to go before he's completely comfortable in his body. He doesn't have much chest hair, does he? I like a bit more chest hair."<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Jim McBride, creator of MrSkin.com</strong>:<br>"I do appreciate the tan lines. That look takes me back to my secret Playboy collection from the '70s."</p><p><strong>David Leddick, author of Nude Male and Escort: 40 Profiles with Photographs of Men Who Sell Sex</strong>:<br>"My book Escort features guys who are selling their bodies. Levi has a nice body, but he's not in that league at all. He doesn't have what it takes to get $150 an hour. His best feature is his face. He has something in his face. Were I Levi, I'd want to be an actor for camera, not stage. I'd pursue a career in acting. If he's got the right management, he should try to act. He's not so different from <strong>Clark Gable</strong>, <strong>Gary Cooper</strong> — a lot of major stars who didn't come from a superior background. He's got something — you can go all the way with a great face."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Edward Norwick, general manager of New York City's Scores strip club</strong>:<br>"I've seen a lot of naked women, and I could see a woman in those poses with those facial looks. His expressions are a little effeminate. I would have approached it with a more macho image, not quite as sensitive. His head is turned coyly to the camera with doe eyes! I had hoped for his first shoot, it would be a little more rugged — a man's man. A little more like Burt Reynolds."</p><p><strong>David Todd, Men's Director, Nous Model Management:</strong><br>"He's a great looking young man, but he definitely needs to slim down more if he wants to sign with a high-fashion agency. He’s got to get those cheekbones showing, he's got to get his body toned down. You have to be at least six feet [tall] or six-one for high-fashion [modeling]. Levi might go more towards commercial print, maybe endorsing a product, like Axe cologne or something like that, instead of doing a huge print campaign for Tom Ford."</p><p><strong>Jon Barrett, editor-in- chief of <a href=#>The Advocate</a></strong>:<br>"He has such a lumberjack-like persona in clothes that I expected to see more of that — including the log — in the Playgirl pics. Instead, we see a Levi who's playing a coy game of peek-a-boo. This is certainly no 'northern exposure.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacoJmlvaa6w5qjnqtdorylsctmmqiloKGuqrrSZpibp6Wpeq2x1aJko6eYo8C1u82sZKGZmafGbq3RpqeirKNif3F8mGtqamlf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
