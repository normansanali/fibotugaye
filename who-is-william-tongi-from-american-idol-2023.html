While the 18-year-old Hawaiian demonstrated his singing abilities in front of the judges during the audition stage, the contender made the judges cry with his heartbreaking story of losing his father a few months before his audition. The talented young man is known for his folk-indie love songs.</strong></p><p>The current season of American Idol will feature celebrity judges Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, and Katy Perry. Season 21’s schedule includes auditions, Hollywood Week, Showcase Rounds, and the Top 24 rounds, in which contestants will perform solo and celebrity duet performances. Following the Top 24, participants will be reduced to the Top 16, then the Top 12, who will be allowed to compete in the live events.</p><h2>Meet William Tongi, an 18-year-old contestant on American Idol 2023</h2><p>William “Guy” Tongi, 18, is of Tongan/Samoan/Irish descent and was born in Kahuku, Hawaii, on September 1, 2004, to parents Rodney Guy and Lillie N Rodney Tongi. The adolescent possesses a rare combination of musical abilities that few can match.</p><p>Despite his youth, the American Idol contestant has already released a song titled Dreams in 2020. He wrote it for his sister’s wedding in particular. His sister told him about herself and her then-fiancé, her now-husband, and turned it into a great love song.</p><p>Tongi is a senior at Decatur High School in Washington State. In the fifth grade, he became interested in music after taking ukulele lessons from a teacher. William then picked up his guitar and began to play. Lauren Gruwell, a singer/songwriter, describes his music as a mix of country and alternative, but he believes that fans often associate it with an island. Tongi is also a guitarist and ukulele player.</p><p>Tongi frequently posts song covers on Tiktok and Instagram. He has over 500,000 likes on his profile and over 77,000 TikTok followers. “I Can’t Make You Love Me” by Bonnie Raitt and “Look at Us” by Vince Gill are among the songs he has covered. William believes that music helps him concentrate and that he has ADHD, according to the preface of a 2020 appearance on the Rikishi Driver Talk Show.</p><p>According to William’s social media profiles, his father, Rodney, who passed away in late 2021 at the age of 50, had a significant influence on his musical taste. William described his father as a musician. He is the youngest of four siblings, the others being sisters Cassandra Alvina and Leilei Tongi, as well as brother Leorod Tongi.</p><p>William described how he dealt with grief and how his father’s hands introduced him to music while competing for American Idol. Tongi performed “Monster,” a song written by musician James Blunt for his father, at his audition. Tongi’s performance moved the judges.</p><p>Viewers of American Idol are aware that some Hawaiian artists have progressed past the audition round and competed in previous seasons. Jordan Segundo came in 26th place in Season 2, Jasmine Trias came in third in Season 3, Camile Velasco came in ninth in Season 19, and Eli-Mac came in third in Season 3. Will William Iam Tongi outperform them all to claim first place? We’ll have to see what happens.</p><h2>American Idol 2023 will premiere. On February 19, 2019</h2><p>American Idol returns to ABC for its sixth season, the show’s 21st overall. The nationwide search for the next version of the show began with auditions in Las Vegas, Nashville, and New Orleans, where hopefuls competed for the chance to attend Hollywood Week. Ryan Seacrest, the Emmy-winning host of American Idol season 21, has stated that the season will be “really amazing” and will feature many contestants who are genuinely committed to their craft.</p><p>Idol released teaser footage of one of the contestants, 16-year-old Haven Madison, prior to the show’s premiere. Her father, a Christian band’s lead singer, raised her in a tour van. Throughout her interview, he played the guitar. Her rendition of an original song, “Fifteen,” was a daring move.</p><p>Platinum seats for the performance are expected to reopen. At each audition location, the judges will distribute platinum tickets. During Hollywood Week, the applicant is given a position and has access to the performances of other candidates in order to select the best duet partner. Season 21 of American Idol premieres on ABC on February 19 at 8 p.m. ET. New episodes will be available on Hulu the day after they air on ABC, at 3 a.m. ET.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Singer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>InnoVator</a></h3>InnoVator estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
