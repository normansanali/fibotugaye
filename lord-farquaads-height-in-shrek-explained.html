This terrifyingly hilarious character, voiced by John Lithgow, is known for his towering pride, which is obviously in compensation for his short stature, but just how short is the first antagonist of the Shrek films? We endeavor to present the facts of the matter.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-how-tall-is-lord-farquaad data-injectable=false><strong>How tall is Lord Farquaad?</strong></h2><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>Farquaad’s height is<strong> </strong>approximately 3 feet. This came from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview</a> with an actor from Shrek the Musical and makes Farquaad shorter than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shrek: Forever After</a>’s Rumpelstiltskin, who is 4 feet 7 inches. Shrek, upon seeing Farquaad’s Castle Duloc, even points out its ridiculous height and tells Donkey that the dictator could be “compensating for something”. Still, take this answer with a tiny grain of salt. There hasn’t been an official confirmation about Farquaad’s canon height.</p><h2 id=h-discovering-farquaad-s-real-height data-injectable=false><strong>Discovering Farquaad’s real height</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>Some scenes in the first Shrek film give clues to Farquaad’s height. First, the scene showing Farquaad walking in his castle focuses on the parts of his body. As the camera zooms out and shows him passing by two men guarding a door, we can see that he is very short as his head reaches to about the guardsmen’s waists.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>Also, in the scene where he approaches Gingy, we can see that Farquaad’s head, particularly his eyes, is just as high as the surface of the table where the sentient bread is placed. He is so short that the table had to be lowered before he could talk to the Gingerbread man. These clues imply one of two things: Either Farquaad’s men are very tall, or he is very short.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=false>All that said, we don’t really have an exact measurement of Farquaad’s height. Regardless, he is a short man who has a long involvement with the Shrek franchise and is known for giving tall orders to people bigger than him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo6iqlGKzor7QrpianKNitaa1xqGrZqGeYsCpvsSkZJ6woKGuqrrEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
