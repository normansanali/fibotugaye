She began dating Sean Van Der Wilt in 2015, but the pair later broke up.</p><p>She was rumored to be dating writer and YouTuber Jason Nash at the start of 2018. Later, when she began appearing in his social media posts and videos, the rumors were confirmed.</p><p>Additionally, she has worked with Jason on his YouTube channel and appeared in a number of his vlogs. Jason, who is also a divorcee and the father of two of his children, was chastised for using his relationship with her to increase his social media followers. The couple, however, has mocked the theories and has continued to be a couple.</p><p>They began dating in 2017 but were reported to have ended their relationship in February 2019. According to the most recent online reports, she was having an affair with drummer Jon Hill.</p><h2><span id=Trisha_Paytas_Height_and_Weight>Trisha Paytas Height and Weight</span></h2><p>Trisha is a lovely young lady with an incredible personality. She is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs approximately 86 kilograms. Her chest, waist, and hip measurements are 34-26-35 inches. She is hazel-eyed and has blonde hair. Additionally, she wears an 8-size shoe (US).</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Trisha began working as a stripper to support herself while auditioning for minor modeling assignments and foreign commercials. That is not to say that the initial phase was without highlights.</p><p>In 2006, she made her television debut as a presenter on the much-hyped but ultimately unsuccessful ‘Greg Behrendt Show.’ She competed in the second season of ‘Who Wants to Be a Superhero?’, a reality television show hosted by Stan Lee, the legendary comic book writer.</p><p>Trisha Yearwood made numerous guest appearances on television shows such as ‘Modern Family,’ ‘The Price is Right,’ and ‘The Ellen DeGeneres Show’ between 2008 and 2011.</p><p>Trisha then began proactively vlogging on YouTube. From intensely personal confessions to meltdowns, from silly banter to naive rants, Trisha’s channel contains all of the ingredients necessary to satisfy the audience’s appetites.</p><p>In 2013, Trisha surpassed the million-follower mark on YouTube. The surge in popularity coincided with the publication of two of her books – ‘The Stripper Diaries’ and ‘The History of My Insanity’. In 2014, she conceptualized, co-produced, and starred in a 15-minute short film titled ‘Viral Video’.</p><p>That was not the end of the story. Ever ambitious, Trisha soon ventured into music – a risky move that paid off handsomely. Her fourth EP, ‘Daddy Issues,’ in 2016, peaked at No. 6 on the iTunes pop chart and was certified gold by Billboard.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Is Deadliest Catch’s Josh Harris Wed?
