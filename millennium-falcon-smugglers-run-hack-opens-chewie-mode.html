He would later appear in the last three issues of the five-part Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge comic book miniseries published by Marvel from April to August of 2019, which is set in the Black Spire Outpost on Batuu where the story of the Galaxy Edge’s theme parks take place.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>The Smugglers Run attraction involves six-person flight crews borrowing the Falcon from Chewbacca and traveling to Corellia, the homeworld of Han Solo, to intercept a First Order train shipment of coaxium, the hyperfuel introduced in Han’s 2018 origin story, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Solo: A Star Wars Story</a>. During the flight, Hondo coaches the crew through their mission, after which he delivers a status report on the Falcon and gives them their score.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Star-Wars-Galaxys-Edge-Mark-Hamill-and-Harrison-Ford.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Star-Wars-Galaxys-Edge-Mark-Hamill.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Star-Wars-Galaxys-Edge-Mark-Hamill-2.png><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Now, the hosts of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FreshBaked!</a> have discovered a heretofore unknown hack that opens the attraction’s secret Chewie Mode, and they’ve assembled a ragtag crew of vloggers to show you how to do it for yourself. Like the famed Konami Code, the hack involves a sequence of maneuvers that must be executed before the cast member completes the pre-flight safety check.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>The left pilot must hold their controls to the extreme left or right, and the right pilot must hold their controls to the extreme up or down, and then press their activation buttons. The engineers and gunners must also hold one of the white buttons on their consoles before pressing the orange activation button, “kind of like using the shift key on a keyboard.”</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>The end result removes Hondo and the canisters of coaxium from the story entirely, replacing them with the infuriated howling of Chewbacca, with the Wookie becoming more enraged as the ship sustains more damage. The covert narrative mode is the kind of buried reward that gamers love unearthing, and exactly the sort of immersive next-level storytelling that the Disney theme parks excel at.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=false><strong>Millennium Falcon – Smugglers Run</strong> can be experienced at Disneyland in Anaheim, California and at Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida, with FastPasses available to be booked now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopKKknJq7r7XUpmSfmZyYvK950qasoJ%2Bcmr%2B0edGupWagkZi4brvPnqWsZZOdsri1xGakqJyVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
