(The couple tied the knot in 2006 after meeting on the set of Lifetime’s Mind Over Murder one year prior.)</p><p>“He’s up, he’s waking the girls up, I’m waking the boys up and we’re just doing it together,” she explained. “I’m like, ‘I’m really lucky to have this.’ When I’m working, he is there. When he’s working, I’m there. We kind of just trade off, so it works.”</p><p>Although the <a href=#>Troop Beverly Hills</a> actress and the Open Range actor were in sync in 2019, they made <a href=#>headlines two years later</a> when they were spotted in 2021 without their wedding rings. In September of that year, <a href=#>McDermott claimed his wife forgot to put hers back on</a> after washing her hands. As for his own piece of jewelry, he said that he lost it while playing golf.</p><p>The twosome added fuel to the split rumors in November 2021 when the Slasher alum was <a href=#>noticeably absent from the family’s holiday card</a>. Tori, however, later <a href=#>clarified that her spouse was out of the country</a> filming when they took the picture.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The following year, Dean, who also shares son Jack with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Mary Jo Eustace</strong></a>, <a href=#>joined his brood for their annual Christmas card snap</a>. “It’s my favorite time of year!” the former Love at First Lie host wrote via Instagram in November 2022 alongside a photo of couple with <a href=#>all five of their kids and Tori’s stepson, Jack</a>. “And this year is extra special. We’re ALL together! ❤️.”</p><p>Scroll down to get to know all of Tori and Dean’s family members:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwbC%2ByGaqqZ2cobavs4ydnJqmXaKwpbHRpqatrKNis6K5yKWwZp%2BlnrGmedOhnKKqXWp6rLXDrGSmp6KafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
