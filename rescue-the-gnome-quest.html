(Speak to them)</span></p><p><span>Passing a skill check will allow you to make the goblins go away, making it easy for you to release the gnome from the windmill.</span></p><h3><b>2) Defeat the Goblins (Optional)</b></h3><p><span>If things didn’t go smoothly with the dialogue, you can resort to <span><a href=#>killing the goblins</a></span> before you aim to release the gnome.</span></p><h3><b>3) Stop The Windmill</b></h3><p><span>You will need to stop the windmill before you can release the gnome by untying his bindings, which will allow you to talk to him after.</span></p><h3><b>4) Untie the Gnome</b></h3><p><span>Now that the windmill has come to a halt, you may untie the gnome and a conversation will begin with the two of you.</span></p><h2><b>Rescue the Gnome Quest Walkthrough</b></h2><p><span>Upon reaching the windmill, you will have a conversation <span><a href=# rel=nofollow>with Fezzerk</a></span>, the goblin boss, and he will taunt you.
