Castro allegedly subjected the women to terrible treatment, kept them imprisoned in the basement for an extended period, and allowed them to hardly ever leave.

At John Marshall High School in late May, they also shared honorary diplomas.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>I can go out unless I like, Amanda said on Amanda Berry News while describing the everyday pleasures she enjoys.
