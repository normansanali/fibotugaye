Since the release of that unfortunate film, <i>Elizabethtown</i>, he’s kept a relatively low profile and released two music documentaries (<i>Pearl Jam Twenty</i> and <i>The Union</i>, with Elton John). So when the director announced that his big return to feature filmmaking would be a family movie ridiculously titled <i>We Bought a Zoo</i>, it didn’t exactly seem like — to quote <i>Say Anything</i>’s Lloyd Dobler — a “dare-to-be-great situation.” After seeing the surprisingly sap-free <i>Zoo</i> (starring Matt Damon and <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson</a>), Vulture sat down with the good-natured Crowe, who explained how this trip to the <i>Zoo</i> lifted his spirits — and also shared tips on making mixtapes and stealing set lists from Pearl Jam.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-dbfc790a3b67585af255bfc079c77420-3-0-0@published data-word-count=23><b>It’s been reported that you courted Matt Damon for this role by <a href=#>making him a mixtape</a>.

With this one, the [cast] also made mixtapes for me. Because I started to ask them to give me something. Scarlett’s was great: like, Bob Dylan, some Tom Waits, old Rolling Stones. And Elle Fanning made a mixtape that was very heavy on Florence and the Machine. I’d play it while they were acting, and they would all have their own kind of musical world.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-dbfc790a3b67585af255bfc079c77420-5-0-0@published data-word-count=20><b>Your last two movies were music documentaries.

To me, only if something comes from an inauthentic place should you feel vulnerable to the things that anybody might say. But if you look at yourself and say, “You know, tribute to my dad.” I stand behind it and didn’t feel savaged. It was a little brutal. But I get that people want to express themselves. I express myself, too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-dbfc790a3b67585af255bfc079c77420-11-0-0@published data-word-count=25><b>Most of your previous features were somehow personal.

It wasn’t like, “I’m gonna do a movie for my kid.” It’s a great story: Guy wants to get over loss, isn’t sure what he has to surmount. It’s got animals attached, and the animals end up being a metaphor for getting over grief. And it becomes a joyful story. And it was a lot like the Marvin Gaye movie, which we were ready to make [but Will Smith turned down the role]. <i>Marvin</i> is a tale about a guy who took his own personal pain and turned it into joy for the world. So this was kind of like another slant on that story.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-dbfc790a3b67585af255bfc079c77420-13-0-0@published data-word-count=5><b>So what’s your next movie?</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-dbfc790a3b67585af255bfc079c77420-14-0-0@published data-word-count=11>I can’t tell you.

They did five hours of press after the movie in Toronto, and all sat together for every writer. And I would follow these writers out into the hallway and go, “You have NO idea.” So after we did the <i>Jimmy Fallon</i> show, we were all sitting around, and I asked them, “Who is the John Coltrane who would make <i>A Love Supreme</i> today?” Because I love talking about music, and those guys are super music geeks.
