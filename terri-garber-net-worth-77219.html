She was fun. She slept with seven West Point men, one after another, and was in on a plot to assassinate Jefferson Davis. People still come up to me in airports and comment on that, laughingâ€”about the West Pointers, not about trying to kill Davis.</p><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1982</span><p>Garber's acting debut was as Allison Linden on the daytime soap opera <i>Texas</i> in 1982. Her first feature film role in the 1984 action film <i>Toy <a href=#>Soldiers</a></i>.</p><span>1985</span><p>Garber met her first husband, <a href=#>Screenwriter</a> Chris Hager, when he was working as a grip on the set of <i>North and South: Book II</i> in 1985. She and Hager are the parents of <a href=#>Actress</a> and singer Molly E. Hager (born 1986). That union ended in divorce in 1989. Her second marriage, to Frank Howson (2001â€“02), also ended in divorce. In 2013, Garber married <a href=#>Director</a> <a href=#>william</a> Roudebush, her former high school drama <a href=#>Teacher</a>.</p><span>1987</span><p>Garber grew up in Miami, the youngest of three children of a <a href=#>Lawyer</a> father and a cooking-school owner mother. She did some modeling from ages 4 to 13, and always wanted to be a performer. Garber told <i>TV Guide</i> in 1987 that she chose acting over singing because "I was too nervous to sing in front of peopleâ€”it meant showing more of myself than acting. If you're on stage singing and people don't like it, that's too much rejection." She later moved to New York, where her <a href=#>Casual</a> drug use became what she called "a huge problem". She overcame the addiction before being cast in <i>North and South</i>.</p><span>2012</span><p>In 2012, Garber appeared as Elizabeth <a href=#>Archer</a> in the series finale of the teen drama web series <i>Miss Behave</i>. She later won a 2013 Indie Soap Award for Best Guest Appearance in a Drama for the performance.</p><span>2013</span><p>In 2013, Garber played a therapist on the web series <i>Old Dogs & New Tricks</i> (Season 2, Episode 10: "Last Gasps").</p><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1960 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>American television actresses</a> <a href=#>American soap opera actresses</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmekmr%2BztYygmKualad6r7HTZq6oqqSdeniDkWpw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
