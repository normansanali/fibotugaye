And it is, yes, Selena Gomez and Andrew “Drew” Taggart we speak of. The rumored pair is believed to be very casual and low-key and not so secretive about their romance.</p><p>In the meantime, let us tell you in this writing who Selena’s alleged boyfriend’s parents are.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Drew Taggart’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Drew Taggart is a one-part of the DJ duo, The Chainsmokers, who rose to stardom in 2016. Besides, he is a famous DJ and a Grammy-winning musician. He was born to his parents on 16 May 1985. So, he turned 37 years old in 2022, making him much more senior than Selena who turned 30 on 22 July of that year.</p><p>Back to his parents, Drew has been lucky because they were not always loving but also always supportive of his passion for music. They are the ones who first saw him develop this “insatiable appetite” for music of all kinds.</p><p>Months before the Grammy awards were about to be handed out in 2017, his mother gushed with the media about her son always being super musical growing up. She explained how music was always the thing he went to when he was happy and sad.</p><p>Laura Girr, his mother, said a study abroad semester in Argentina during his junior year of high school is what helped spark Drew’s interest in techno music.</p><h3><strong>Meet Laura Girr, Drew Taggart’s Mother</strong></h3><p>Drew Taggart shares a very special relationship with his mother Laura Girr, aka Laura Girr Taggart. He even took her as his date at the Grammy awards event back when he won his first career Grammy for Best Dance Recording for “Don’t Let Me Down” alongside fellow Chainsmoker. Drew did buy tickets for lots of friends and families, but when he had to pick one official “date” as the person to sit next to him, he chose his mom. “How cool is that?” his mom had said as she was planning on wearing a gown.</p><p>Laura is the daughter of the late Leo A. Girr, who passed aged 73 on 10 July 2008, after a brief and sudden illness. Originally from Newport, Rhode Island, he moved to Maine in 1965 and lived there for the rest of his life. Laura also was born there to her late mother Margaret ‘Peggy’ Girr.</p><p>Laura’s dad Girr was famed for his sports memorabilia store Sports Central, the local radio and TV show, Sports Roundtable. He was also the author of the Media Baseball Bible. But, above them all, he was perhaps best known for the successful franchised Business Digest magazine.</p><p>Siblings, Laura has three of them. They are Catherine Girr of South Portland, Jennifer (Girr) Leyne of Melrose, Massachusetts, and Jeffrey Girr of Summit, New Jersey.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Laura Girr Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Laura Girr was born in March 1960.

On Twitter, her job is described as her trying to help people use technology better. On her LinkedIn, she has talked about it in detail. She described being especially interested in the possibilities of personalized learning and seeking to support app developers and users as products are created for this market.</p><p>Seemingly, either retired or taking some time off now, her last job was at Maine Schools. It involved her supporting teachers by working alongside them in the classroom, as well as in small groups and individuals outside of the classroom, as a technology integration specialist. She did this full-time from July 2014 until June 2019.</p><p>Before that, from January 2000 through June 2014, she was a technology coordinator and integrator at Freeport High School. And even prior to that, she&nbsp;taught all levels of Spanish and German in several schools.</p><p>Speaking of her own education, Laura did her BA in Modern Languages at the University of Maine.

While we don’t know much about him, he seems to love watching his son on TV.
