It reveals a lot of the gaslighting, isolation, and hypocrisy that took place behind closed doors at the Playboy mansion.</p><p>Secrets of Playboy introduces America to a woman named <a href=#>Jennifer Saginor</a>. Who exactly is the mysterious girl who used to reside in the luxurious Playboy mansion? Here’s what you should know about Jennifer and where exactly her father is today.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: A&E</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Jennifer Saginor's father now?</h2><p>A lot of people weren’t aware of Hugh Hefner's friendship with a physician named Mark Saginor, aka Dr. Feelgood. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Guide Time</a> reports that he got his nickname because he was apparently constantly prescribing drugs to Hugh and close friends in their inner circle.<strong></strong></p><p>Mark created somewhat of a reputation for himself. By the time his daughter Jennifer was a teenager, she was spending a lot of time in close proximity to the Playboy mansion. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sparked up an affair</a> with one of Hugh's girlfriends during that time.</p><p>Hugh initially considered Jennifer to be one of his own daughters, but later down the line, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their relationship grew tenser</a>. The relationship between Mark and Hugh is rumored to be much more than a platonic bond; there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors that they were secretly lovers</a>.</p><p>Along with Mark being Hugh's personal physician, they were extremely emotionally close with one another. In 2008, things took a turn for Mark, who was accused of medical wrongdoings.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>His medical license was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suspended for five years</a>. The medical board of California stated that he “failed to maintain adequate and accurate medical records in the care and treatment of a patient.” According to Jennifer, Mark and Hugh's friendship in the eyes of the public disappeared even though they continue to spend time together privately.</p><p>In the 2010s, they started hanging out face-to-face once again, and Mark was even at Hugh’s bedside at the time of Hugh's 2017 passing.<strong> </strong>Charges against Mark were eventually dropped and because of that, no legal action was ever taken against him. He still lives in California today, far away from the public eye.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jennifer Saginor (@jennifersaginor)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What about Jennifer Saginor herself?</h2><p>Growing up in the Playboy mansion was obviously a very complicated situation for a young Jennifer, who started living there part-time at the age of 6. By the time she was 11 years old, she had her own dedicated bedroom. Jennifer's memoir references the fact that she witnessed a lot of activities that happened behind the scenes including Hugh's interactions with the young women in the house. She also noticed how he interacted with her father, Mark.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer revealed</a><strong> </strong>that living in the house pushed her down the path of substance abuse, plastic surgery at a young age, and intimacy issues in regard to sex. She earned her communications degree from George Washington University and later penned a memoir called Playground: A Childhood Lost Inside the Playboy Mansion, which was published in 2005.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, Jennifer's now working as a high-end real estate agent in the Beverly Hills area and has been on a sobriety journey for 12 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KvusifnKtlo5a0qrrOq2SfmaSdsrN5zaiu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
