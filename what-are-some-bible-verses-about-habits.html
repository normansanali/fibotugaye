God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.<br>1 Corinthians 6:12<br>“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be enslaved by anything.<br>Hebrews 10:25<br>Not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.<br>Mark 7:20-23<br>And he said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles him. For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.”<br>Ephesians 5:1<br>Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.<br>Jeremiah 13:23<br>Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil.<br>Acts 20:35<br>In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’<br>2 Peter 2:19<br>They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.<br>Ephesians 4:28<br>Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need.<br>2 Timothy 1:7<br>For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.<br>1 Corinthians 11:1<br>Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.<br>Matthew 7:12<br>So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.<br>Philippians 4:8<br>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.<br>Proverbs 22:6<br>Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.<br>Job 31:5-6<br>If I have walked with falsehood and my foot has hastened to deceit; (Let me be weighed in a just balance, and let God know my integrity!)<br>2 Timothy 2:26<br>And they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.<br>1 Thessalonians 5:17<br>Pray without ceasing,<br>Romans 6:15-16<br>What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?<br>1 Thessalonians 5:18<br>Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.<br>Unless otherwise noted, all Bible verses are from The Holy Bible, English Standard Version® Copyright© 2001 by Crossway Bibles, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.<br>Special thanks to OpenBible.info for the data on the most well-known Bible verses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSesrSu1LOxZ5ufonuotI6wn5qsXZa%2FpnnSqKSeZZKer62xjK%2Bcq6uVqHqirs6uq2agkZe2tb%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
