Arm: 45.</p><p>Louisville produced back-to-back high-end catching prospects in 2021 and 2022, with Henry Davis selected No. 1 overall in 2021 and Dalton Rushing selected No. 40 overall in 2022. Payton is next in line at the Louisville catching factory, and like the two players preceding him has an impressive offensive resume. He led Louisville with a .350 average, 89 hits and 23 doubles in 2022, then played with USA Baseball’s Collegiate National Team and in the Cape Cod League during the summer. He had another strong offensive season in 2023, when he slashed .374/.472/.642 with 12 home runs and 10 doubles. Payton has lots of strength in a filled-out, 5-foot-11, 200-pound frame, with the ability to drive the ball out to the pull side and the opposite field, though he’s done most of his damage middle-in, with a tendency to leak out and open up on his front side after a toe tap—which can hurt his ability to cover the outer third. Payton did well against 92-plus mph velocity in 2022, but struggled against that pitch type in 2023. He’s an aggressive hitter who will expand the zone and also has a high miss rate against breaking stuff and offspeed offerings, leading to more fringe-average hitting projections. Payton needs to work on his actions and receiving to stick behind the plate in pro ball. He has fringy arm strength and has a long exchange times, and could also clean up the direction with his footwork. He moves well for a catcher and could potentially play an outfield corner if he has to move from behind the plate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufonyxuMCynKurX2aGcoWPZqGam5tivaLF06ilaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
