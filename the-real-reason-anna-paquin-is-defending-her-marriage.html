She included the caption, "If he doesn't have a problem with it why should anyone else?" The actor also took to <a href=#>Instagram Stories</a> (via <a href=#>People</a>) to share a comment that said, "I am getting tired of seeing 'bi' celebrities consistently advocate for it only to end up conventionally married to men with multiple children, living out the so-called white-picket-fence life." Paquin added, "Ah yes ... the 'you aren't queer enough' BS."</p><p dir=ltr>This isn't the first time Paquin has discussed her bisexuality. In 2010, she came out in the <a href=#>Give a Damn campaign</a>, which featured celebrities pushing for equality. "I'm Anna Paquin. I'm <a href=#>bisexual, and I give a damn</a>," she said at the time. And in June 2014, she <a href=#>tweeted</a> in support of gay marriage, writing, "Proud to be a happily married bisexual mother. Marriage is about love not gender."</p><p dir=ltr>The also actor got candid with Zooey magazine (via People) in 2012, saying, "If you're going to talk about some cause in a way that's meaningful, you should identify why it means something to you," she said. "For a bisexual, it's not about gender. That's not the deciding factor for who they're attracted to." Paquin has no problem <a href=#>calling out "bigots,"</a> and she'll keep dispelling myths about bisexuality as long as trolls comment on her posts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWllZYVxe9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2Wu6%2BtjKmYqq2Zo3qqv4ydnJ%2Bdnpm2r7OMoZyrZZ2Wv7O1wKCcaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
