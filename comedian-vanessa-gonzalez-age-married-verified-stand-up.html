Her sketch series, Ms. Vanessa, draws on her time teaching and has popped up in several sets over the years. She said she loved working with kids and teaching “definitely” influenced her as far as how she looks at things.</p><p>And once she started comedy, there also came a time in her career when she received an Insta­gram DM from Chelsea Han­dler ask­ing to be her open­er.
