In <a href=#>an interview with Songfacts</a>, rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke noted that he hadn't been involved with the song, as it was recorded while he was touring in support of his solo album. Clarke called the snub the "last straw" for him, noting, "nobody had said anything to me and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands."</p><p>Rose replaced Clarke with "childhood friend Paul Tobias," <a href=#>according to Far Out magazine</a>, which reportedly made Slash unhappy. Furthermore, Slash was a fan of the 1976 novel&nbsp;Interview With The Vampire, written by Anne Rice,&nbsp;and was intrigued by the opportunity to record a song for the film adaptation. His enthusiasm waned after he caught a preview of the movie and, reports Far Out, "hated" it.</p><p>He also didn't appreciate Rose telling him to perform the song's guitar solo "more like Keith Richards." Slash remembered, "Keith's playing is so awesome on that song that I didn't want to even come near it, but I did. And doing so left me feeling even more p***** and put out than ever." Slash seemed to speak for a number of people when he finally proclaimed, "If there is one Guns track I'd like to never hear again, it's that one."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bl2xnbnFfrLW6ecaupaxlnmK%2FsL%2FErGSwmaNiu6bCxKtkraCVYsCiucRmmJ%2Bslad6tMXMqZitoKlis7C%2BjK2fnmWUmsOquI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
