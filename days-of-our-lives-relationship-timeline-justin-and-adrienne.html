Eventually, their friendship turned into stronger feelings, although they tried to hide it. Justin became suspicious of their connection and decided to work harder on his marriage, but when it was revealed that he had an affair, Adrienne immediately turned to Lucas and the two got romantic, per <a href=#>Soap Central</a>. Lucas and Adrienne eventually got engaged, but on the day of their wedding, Justin crashed the ceremony. Justin and Adrienne reunited again and decided to hold their fourth wedding.</p><p dir=ltr>The pair opted to have a double wedding with Jack Deveraux (Matthew Ashford) and Jennifer Horton (Melissa Reeves) this time around. After the ceremony, Jennifer was pushed from a balcony and ended up in a coma. Jennifer was in a coma for a year, and when she woke up she learned that Adrienne had been killed in a car accident, seemingly ending her and Justin's love story for good (via <a href=#>Soaps in Depth</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>Although Adrienne passed away, actress Judi Evans returned to "Days of Our Lives" in the role of Adrienne's doppelgänger Bonnie Lockhart. Bonnie eventually fell for Justin and the two ended up married. Since "DOOL" fans are used to seeing characters return from the dead, viewers can't help but wonder if there's a way that Adrienne will make her way back to Salem in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57l21raWhnZLGixdJmpp9ln6q%2FbrjIr5ysZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq1tcyeo6KmlWK3tr%2FToqVmmZ6ZeqKw0aKcp6aVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
