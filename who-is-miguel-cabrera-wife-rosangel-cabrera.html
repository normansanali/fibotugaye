He was raised in his native country, and by the time he was a teenager, it was already obvious he would become as talented a player as he is today.</p><p>Miguel Cabrera Torres, also known as “Miggy,” grew up in the LaPadrera neighborhood with his sister Ruth Cabrera Torres and parents who were familiar with baseball because they had played a little of it themselves as children. They could easily persuade him to play a little bit more as a result. Additionally, his uncles Jose and David Torres were present to instruct him.</p><p>When he was younger, Miggy rose to the top of South America’s most sought-after baseball players.

He exchanged places with the Detroit Tigers in 2008. He stayed with that team until 2014, when he agreed to a $248 million contract extension that would keep him there through at least 2022.</p><p>He won the World Championship and two League Championships and was regarded as one of the best hitters of his generation in MLB and beyond. Moreover, Miguel was named to 11 MLB All-Star teams, was selected for four Tigers of the Year, and was the recipient of two Hank Aaron Awards, five Luis Aparicio Awards, and seven Silver Slugger Awards.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-wife-of-miguel-cabrera><strong>Who is the wife of Miguel Cabrera?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/03958-16697368610179-1920-696x491.webp><p>Sports in general and baseball in particular were encouraged in Miguel Cabrera’s family.

The baseball player was also paying his two children with the mistress $15,000 per month in child support.</p><p>Cabrera and his wife reached an agreement to end all contact with Belkis Rodriguez in order to save their marriage. As a result, Cabrera changed his phone number and stopped providing support for children who are 5 years old and older. February 2018, at age 2.</p><p>After that, Rodriguez took him to court and demanded that he pay her $20,000 per month in child support, which is what she claims he had always done. Later on, it was discovered that she actually wanted $100,000 because he was making $30 million annually.</p><p>Regrettably for Belkis, who was enraged that Rosangel Cabrera wouldn’t leave Cabrera for her, the court ordered her to pay $12,000 in child support while funding their education and other expenses.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Together with his wife, Miguel has three children: Christopher Alexander Cabrera, Isabella Cabrera, and Rosangel Cabrera, in addition to his two children with Rodriquez.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miguel-cabrera-children><strong>Miguel Cabrera children</strong></h2><p>Rosangel and Miguel have three children (Christopher, Isabella, and Rosangel).
