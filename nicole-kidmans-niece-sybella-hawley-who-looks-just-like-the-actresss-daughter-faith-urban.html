Born slightly ahead of schedule, Sybella's arrival was witnessed by an intimate circle including her father, grandparents, and her elder sister, Lucia, marking a beautifully orchestrated family moment.</p><p id=edPHsFOjOWI data-wc=41>Antonia shared the serene experience: "I asked Lucia beforehand if she’d like to come to the hospital to see the birth of her sibling. It was something she was very keen to be a part of,” she penned for New Idea.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ff7afe0a3234-snapinstaapp911272626807627458259133415406340283749911n1080.jpg><p id=efP8u9MIPsb data-wc=60>“As I have a fairly cautious nature, I didn’t build up the occasion too much in case something happened that meant it might be better if she stayed home. It was decided the boys were a little too young – the idea of three or even two children present during a painful labor was a little too much to bear."</p><p id=ei58C2Hgh_L data-wc=104>"The whole thing went according to plan. I went into labor one day early and, as my last two pregnancies were both a week overdue, her timely arrival was quite a surprise. At the first signs of labor we headed across Sydney to the Royal Hospital for Women in Randwick, where all of our children have been born. My labors so far have all been fairly short and intense and this one proved no different. It was all over within a couple of hours, and Sybella Ann Kidman Hawley was born in the presence of her father, grandmother, grandfather and doting sister," Antonia added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ae01d26d4ec2-gettyimages-2150526422.jpg><p id=eVfGMdj7Q-m data-wc=88>She concluded, "Three months down the track and Lucia’s connection to her little sister grows stronger every day. From those first moments of Sybella’s life in the delivery suite when she held and helped bathe her baby sister, Lucia has been reluctant to give Sybella up. In fact, prising her away from her older sister can be quite a challenge. Lucia has definitely placed first dibs on Sybella and at times I’ve had to schedule time for the boys to spend with their sister when Lucia’s not around."</p><p id=eh-RgVTcwhO data-wc=32><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
