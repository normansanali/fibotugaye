Over the years, both Sly and Arnie have had their share of injuries and ailments.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>For example, while making "Rocky IV," Stallone was put in the ICU for days after his co-star, Dolph Lundgren, punched him during a fight scene. Among his other injuries, Stallone has damaged his shoulders, rotator cuff, knees, and has gotten stitches on his hand and under his arm. He also suffered a hairline fracture in his neck during the making of "The Expendables." Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=#>Schwarzenegger has had his share of bodily damage</a>, including&nbsp;a hip replacement, rotator cuff surgery, and broken bones. Schwarzenegger has also dealt with some major heart issues. He underwent a pulmonary valve replacement in 1997, had&nbsp;update on that surgery in 2018, and had&nbsp;an aortic valve replacement in 2020.</p><p>Perhaps it was inevitable, then, that Arnie and Sly would find themselves getting surgery at the same time. In 2012, in a strange twist of fate, both men&nbsp;were in the same hospital at the same time, and both were going under the knife for shoulder surgery. Unbeknownst to either of them, their surgeries were scheduled back-to-back. For an added surprise, sources cited by <a href=#>Yahoo! News</a> claimed that Sly waited his turn until Arnie woke up from his operation. Just another casual meet-up for these action stars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtjZ4N0gY6ssKWulajBpr6MrKuapJyku6Z51axkmqqepLmledKcn7CZoq%2Byr7HGoJyrZZaawqV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
