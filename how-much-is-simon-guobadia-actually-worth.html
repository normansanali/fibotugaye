Now, he also <a href=#>executive produces movies</a>, such as "Son of the South" and "Jail Dogs," among others.</p><p>Per <a href=#>Stars Offline</a>, these business ventures have earned him $40 million over the years. (For comparison's sake, Porsha Williams is worth $400,000, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, and her ex, Dennis McKinley, is worth $10 million, <a href=#>per the same outlet</a>.) Porsha and Dennis' daughter, baby PJ, is in good hands financially, but also emotionally, as Porsha said that she, Simon, and Dennis plan to co-parent PJ together. She wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>," Simon and Dennis are committed to being respectful and supportive of my happiness in this situation, as well as being the best co-parents they can be to baby PJ."</p><p>Per <a href=#>Radar Online</a>, Simon and Falynn Guobadia's divorce didn't cost him too much money, as the site revealed that "Falynn will not receive any spousal support or alimony," and that Simon got to keep "all of his cars and his separate properties." The pair also split the $307,450 they earned from the sale of one of their homes.</p><p><a href=#>Simon has five kids from a previous marriage</a>, and Falynn,has three kids from a previous relationship as well â€” so they might all be one big happy family soon enough.
