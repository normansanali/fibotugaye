Benjamin Roberts-Smith VC, MG is a former soldier of the Australian Army who has been found guilty of committing war crimes during his time in Afghanistan, as determined in a civil defamation trial. Despite this, Roberts-Smith had received several awards for his military service including the Medal for Gallantry in 2006, the Victoria Cross for Australia in 2011, and a Commendation for Distinguished Service in 2012.</p><p>A lot of people have been inquiring lot about Ben Roberts-Smith wife and making various research about her on the internet.</p><p>This article talks about Ben Roberts-Smith wife and everything there is to know about her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biography of Ben Roberts-Smith</h2><p>Ben Roberts-Smith is a former Australian soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia, the highest award for gallantry in combat. Born on November 1, 1978, in Perth, Western Australia, he grew up in the coastal town of Kalbarri before joining the Australian Army in 1996 at the age of 18.</p><p>Roberts-Smith served as a member of the elite Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) and completed multiple tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for his actions during Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan in 2006, where he led a small team of soldiers in a mission to clear an enemy stronghold and rescue stranded coalition personnel. In 2010, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia for his actions in a subsequent operation in Afghanistan where he exposed himself to enemy fire to save his colleagues and eliminate several enemy positions.</p><p>After retiring from the military in 2013 with the rank of Corporal, Roberts-Smith became a public speaker and a spokesperson for various philanthropic organizations, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Legacy Australia.</p><p>In recent years, Roberts-Smith has been embroiled in a high-profile legal battle with Nine Entertainment Co., one of Australia’s largest media companies. The company has accused him of war crimes and other serious misconduct during his time in the military, allegations that Roberts-Smith vehemently denies. The case is ongoing, and its outcome remains uncertain.</p><p>Judge Anthony Besanko made a ruling in June 2023, stating that Roberts-Smith’s defamation case against three publications had been dismissed. The judge found that there was sufficient evidence to support the claim that Roberts-Smith had committed murder of three Afghan men and had broken military engagement regulations, based on the balance of probabilities.</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding him, Ben Roberts-Smith’s bravery and dedication to serving his country have earned him widespread respect and admiration among Australians, particularly those in the military community.</p><p>Is Ben Roberts-Smith married? Not any more, in 1998, Roberts-Smith crossed paths with Emma Groom while stationed at Holsworthy Barracks, Sydney. Groom hailed from a military background and on December 6, 2003, the couple tied the knot at the University of Western Australia.</p><p>Together they welcomed twin daughters in 2010, and in 2013, Roberts-Smith was honored with the title of Australian Father of the Year by The Shepherd Centre – a non-profit charitable organization. Following his retirement from the army in 2015, he relocated to Queensland along with his former spouse and their daughters. Unfortunately, in December 2020, the couple’s divorce was finalized.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ghgossip.com</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpucp2WipK%2BmvtOsZKylmam1brHXZq6inpViuqax02acpqWRYrSzu86mZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
