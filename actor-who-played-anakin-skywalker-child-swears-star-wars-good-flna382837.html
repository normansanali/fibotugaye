So much so, in fact, that he&nbsp;left acting forever.</p><p>"My entire school life was really a living hell, and I had to do up to 60 interviews a day," says Lloyd <a href=#>in a recent interview with the U.K. tabloid The Sun</a>. "Other children were really mean to me…They would make the sound of the lightsaber every time they saw me. It was totally mad.”</p><p>The 22-year-old former actor, who was&nbsp;10 at the time of shooting, recalls the badgering he faced from jealous schoolmates while making the film, and the lasting regret which prompted him to give up acting for good.&nbsp;</p><p>“I've learned to hate it when the cameras are pointed at me," Lloyd says.</p><p>Other than small roles in “Jingle All the Way,” and television shows&nbsp;“ER” and “The Pretender,” Lloyd’s credits as an actor primarily consist of his brief stint with the “Star Wars” franchise. After portraying Anakin in a chain of related video games, the actor chose to&nbsp;leave Hollywood for&nbsp;Chicago, where he recently finished studying film at Columbia College.</p><p>According to The Sun,&nbsp; he destroyed his “Star Wars” memorabilia, and now only makes appearances at sci-fi and comic book festivals, refusing to even watch the films because they are too “creepy.”</p><p>Lloyd’s been known to pout before. In 2009, he made statements bashing George Lucas for failing to meet public expectations with the movie, in this appearance on <a href=#>Australia's SciFiTV.com</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For fans of the preeminent brand, Lloyd’s exit from the big screen is no tragedy to the force.</p><p>“He should count himself lucky,” wrote a reader going as el_gringo1976 on The Sun's article. “I mean,..Let’s face it. I can think of worse things to be traumatized over than being Anakin Skywalker.”</p><p>Adds wingman, “Jake who?”</p><p>Do you think he has enough to complain about, or was he simply lucky to land such a role? <a href=#>Tell us on Facebook.</a></p><p><strong>Related content:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r67Cp5ywq16YvK57z6inZpulocG2vsRop6ioXZjCrcDUq5xmppWswHCtwq2mq2WnnbxuvMuasJ6cXZa7orfIp2Sso6msrq23xKtknKCZobFuv9aemKurXajBor6MsJirq12cvLCwjJ%2Bjp5ljbX95f5Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
