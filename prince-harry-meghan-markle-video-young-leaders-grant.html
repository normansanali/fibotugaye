Over the months ahead, each organization will use grant funding to continue their efforts addressing tech-related issues, from protecting human rights and improving education access, to ensuring responsible use of AI and tackling online bullying.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Thank you for doing everything that you do, our kids are especially grateful … They just don’t know it yet,” Harry jokes to Sneha Revanur, founder of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://encodejustice.org data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Encode Justice" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Encode Justice</a>, a global movement pushing for human rights and justice under AI through political advocacy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“But they will!” Meghan says with a laugh.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since launching in 2020, Revanur’s organization has championed informed AI policy that confronts the bias, discrimination, and surveillance enabled by systems ranging from facial recognition technology to pretrial risk assessment tools.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And chatting with Tazin Khan—founder of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cybercollective.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cyber Collective" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Cyber Collective</a>, which makes the complex topic of cybersecurity more accessible—Meghan praises the digital security influencer for her efforts. “Really, thank you for all the work you’re doing, it’s huge and it’s making an enormous impact,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The video marks the Sussexes’ first official public appearance together since their May 16 attendance at the Ms. Foundation Women of Vision Awards in New York. Its focus is one close to both Harry and Meghan’s hearts, as they have dedicated a large part of their foundation’s work to improving safety online.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Social entrepreneur Trisha Prabhu—who founded <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rethinkwords.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=ReThink class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">ReThink</a>, an award-winning app and patented technology that detects and stops potential online hate before damage is done—says the couple’s support and encouragement will help the organization grow.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was a surreal and special moment,” she tells Bazaar.com of receiving the call. “It really means so much to have the duke and duchess validating us in our mission.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prabhu says the RTYPF grant will help ReThink reach new users beyond the U.S., particularly through its digital literacy curriculum, which equips youth with the knowledge and know-how to become smarter and more responsible online citizens. “I’m really grateful, because the $50,000 we are receiving through this fund will allow us to roll out in the Caribbean,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At a time when big tech companies continue to drag their feet on making platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) safer, ReThink’s approach focuses on what users can do. “[Companies and organizations] were looking at how to support victims of cyberbullying after it happens, which is important, but I wanted to take a more systemic approach and proactively address cyberbullying and empower users to be the best that they can be online and change internet culture,” explains Prabhu, whose work has been commended by MIT and the White House.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the phone conversation with the Sussexes, Prince Harry told Prabhu, whose own cyberbullying experiences as a young teen inspired her to find solutions: “This is amazing, this is exactly why we do what we do. This is exactly why the Youth Power Fund was created.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other grant recipients that received calls from the Sussexes include <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.logoffmovement.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Log Off" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Log Off</a>, a group working to empower young people to rebuild their relationships with social media; and the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://youngpeoplesalliance.org/) data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Young People’s Alliance" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Young People’s Alliance</a>, whose student advocates are working at colleges across North Carolina, state legislatures, and on Capitol Hill to amplify youth voices. Archewell is one of 14 U.S.-based nonprofits and organizations who partnered to invest in the fund.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Societies globally are wrestling with major issues like the youth mental health crisis and the decay of our information environment. What and who can we trust online? Can online spaces be truly safe and affirm wellbeing? And what new systems can we create with, instead of for, young people?” RTYPF co-founder Emma Leiken asked in a statement shared with Bazaar.com. “These questions touch on issues ranging from platform accountability to cybersecurity, privacy, digital literacy, data equity, algorithmic bias, and digital well-being and that’s what this fund's grantees will tackle.”</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/45770d72-fac8-4474-90bb-36e121ad9a67_1543445615.jpeg alt="Headshot of Omid Scobie" title="Headshot of Omid Scobie" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Omid Scobie is <a href=#>BAZAAR.com</a>’s Royal Editor at Large and has covered the lives and philanthropic work of the younger members of the British Royal Family for over eight years.
