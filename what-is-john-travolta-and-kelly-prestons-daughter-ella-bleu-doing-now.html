On the bright side, most famous people are very wealthy, they have a group of people to do their bidding, and people bend over backward to make them happy. On the other end of the spectrum, when a star messes up they garner headlines, the paparazzi invade their privacy, and they can’t go out in public without constant interruptions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>John Travolta Praised As He Spends Time With His Children On Christmas</a></span></p><p>For most people, the only way they can envision what it is like to be famous is by engaging their imaginations. For celebrity kids, however, they grow up watching what their parents go through including the best and worst parts of fame. With that in mind, it is fascinating when <a href=#>celebrity kids become more famous than their parents</a> after following in their footsteps. On the other end, it also is interesting when celebrity kids opt for careers that ensure they remain anonymous. Keeping all of that in mind, when looking at who Ella Bleu Travolta has become, the question is which end of the spectrum did she wind up on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-happened-to-john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-rsquo-s-family>What Has Happened To John Travolta And Kelly Preston’s Family?</h2><p>Over the years, there have been some examples of <a href=#>stars who have dated their fans</a> or at the very least, people who have never been famous. On the other hand, the majority of celebrities have solely dated other famous people since they became well known. Sadly, a lot of celebrity couples wind up going their separate ways after dating. On the other hand, some celebrity couples have stayed together for years and even decades.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things We Just Found Out About John Travolta & Kelly Preston's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Even though there has been a lot of speculation about John Travolta and Kelly Preston’s relationship over the years, they stayed together for decades. During their almost three decades of marriage, Travolta and Preston had three children, a daughter named Ella and two sons named Jett and Benjamin. Based on everything that has been said about their relationship with their kids, it seems very clear that Travolta and Preston both adored their children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for John Travolta and Kelly Preston’s family, they have seen more than their fair share of tragedy over the years. For example, in 2009, Travolta and Preston experienced something that every parent fears above all else when their eldest son suddenly passed away. Only 16-years-old at the time, Jett Travolta was on vacation with his family in the Bahamas when he lost his life after suffering a seizure according to his death certificate. In an attempt to make something good out of tragedy, the pair wound up founding the Jett Travolta Foundation, “a nonprofit organization to help children with special needs”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a stunning turn of events, a second member of John Travolta and Kelly Preston’s family passed away far too early in 2020. After enjoying an extremely successful life and career, Kelly Preston took her last breath at the relatively young age of 57-years-old. For Preston’s millions of fans, her passing seemed sudden since they had no idea what she had gone through. In reality, however, Preston had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years before succumbing to the awful disease. As sad as Preston’s fans were, that pales in comparison to what her immediate family went through. Thankfully, <a href=#>Travolta was there to counsel his kids through the process of grieving</a> the loss of their mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-john-travolta-and-kelly-preston-rsquo-s-daughter-ella-bleu-doing-now>What Is John Travolta and Kelly Preston’s Daughter Ella Bleu Doing Now?</h2><p>As the only daughter of John Travolta and Kelly Preston, Ella Bleu Travolta could have had a lot to live up to since the day she was born. Based on everything that is known about the young woman, she doesn’t seem to be letting any of that potential pressure get to her as she is too busy making her own way in the world. However, that doesn’t mean that Ella is against the idea of following in her parent’s footsteps.</p><p>According to reports, Ella Bleu Travolta considers herself an actor. That said, Ella has only taken on a handful of roles to date. For example, Ella has appeared in a pair of films that starred her famous father, 2009’s Old Dogs in which she had a small role and 2019’s The Poison Rose which she was a much bigger part of. On top of that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ella is set to star in an upcoming movie called Get Lost</a> which is a “modern kooky take on Disney’s Alice in Wonderland film”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of launching an acting career, Ella Bleu Travolta has proven that she shares a lot of the other talents that made her father a star. For example, Ella is a talented singer who writes and records her own songs. In 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ella posted a video of herself performing one of her original songs</a> on social media which her father praised. The clip also was celebrated by most of her followers and even Mötley Crüe’s drummer Tommy Lee chimed in with praise although it has to be said that he is a family friend. On top of Ella’s singing, she showed off her ability to dance when she starred in a Scotts Miracle-Gro commercial alongside her father and the pair showed off their moves together.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything We Know About John Travolta's Daughter, Ella Bleu</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecmon6dlpKeut7vLrZhmmZ6Zeqyxy6WwZqiimsC1u82sZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZpylpJFir62x1GabqKGenHqvu9Zo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
