Believe it or not, he managed to land <a href=#>Stevie Wonder</a> as a guest star, providing backing vocals and a smoking harmonica solo on the track <a href=#>"My God."</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Seagal went back into the studio and emerged with his second LP, "Mojo Priest." As critic Thom Jurek wrote in his&nbsp;<a href=#>AllMusic</a> review of the latter album, "All of this music takes itself so seriously that it borders on delusional excess." Describing Seagal's ability as a guitarist, he added, "It rarely rises above bar band pedigree, and most of the time, isn't that good." As has been the case with his movie career, bad reviews haven't stopped Seagal and his backing band, Thunderbox, from continuing to perform.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to guitars, it appears that Seagal's biggest conundrum is deciding which of them to play, given that he owns a whopping 300 or so. "I collect guitars because I'm a serious player, and I've been playing since I was a child,"&nbsp;he solemnly intoned in a <a href=#>History Channel interview</a>. Among Seagal's hundreds of guitars are axes that once belonged to such artists as Lenny Kravitz, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. In addition, he has four guitars — all signed — that were previously owned by blues legend B.B. King.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxmZYZ1f46rnJqrn6PAbrDOp6tmoJWWv2651JyfZqukmsOmuoysnJqfkaF6orrYpqarnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
