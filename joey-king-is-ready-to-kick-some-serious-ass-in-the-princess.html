The Le-Van Kiet-directed film seems like it’s going to turn the worn-out “damsel in distress” narrative completely inside out, and star Joey King says she’s here for it.</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>The 22-year-old King, best known for playing kid-lit icon Ramona Quimby, may not be the first actor to come to mind for a part that’s more about kicking asses than kissing princes, but The Kissing Booth may be on the verge of breaking out of her wheelhouse.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>“Joey consistently impressed me dramatically,”&nbsp;director Kiet stated at today’s Hulu press conference,&nbsp;“But also physically, and that made this a real joy. We had so much fun. She did it all. We planned for her not to do it all, but she made it happen. Every day she came to work, and she said, ‘I want to do this.’, and she was better than the stunt person.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joey King (@joeyking)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>Speaking at the same conference, King noted that it wasn’t confidence that brought her to the film. It was fear. Not just of getting out of her comfort zone but also of a script that was well over 90 percent action scenes.</p><p>“What made me want to do this movie was that it scared the living hell out of me. The initial script had 95 pages and about 92 of it was fighting. And I thought, OMG, can I do this?….I’ve never really done an action movie before where I’m really in the nitty gritty of the action, and I thought, ‘It’s about time for me!’ “I really did fall in love with martial arts and learning how to fight in the training for this movie. I felt like I unlocked a new confidence in myself that I didn’t know I had. I didn’t know if I could pull this off, but then I did, and that made me feel really empowered.”</p>– Joey King<p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>She seems to have leaned in. Not only will King be fighting her way through The Princess next month, but audiences can catch her slugging it out with the likes of Brad Pitt in John Wick director’s new high-octane action movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bullet Train</a> in August.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>The Princess will debut on Hulu on July 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooaidqWK4qrrGZqCsZaKarqXFjK2mZqOZmLhuv86mnGarlae2sMHSZpisq12eu27Ax55kqaqZo7Cmv9Jo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
