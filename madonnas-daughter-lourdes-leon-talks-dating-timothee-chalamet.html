My first boyfriend … or anything,” Leon, 24, said in an interview with <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> published Wednesday, April 21. The pair met while attending Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School in Manhattan.</p><p>Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed the pair’s relationship</a> in April 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lourdes-Leon-Says-Timothee-Chalamet-Was-Her-1st-Boyfriend.jpg><p>“Dating is a loose term for it, but yes, they are teenagers being teenagers so I guess you can call it that,” a source close to <a href=#><strong>Madonna</strong></a>’s eldest daughter told Us exclusively at the time. “It has not been going on for very long at all.”</p><p>Around the same time, the pair were <a href=#>spotted out and about in New York</a> with Leon’s father, personal trainer <a href=#><strong>Carlos Leon</strong></a>. A few months later, the then-couple <a href=#>engaged in some PDA</a> in front of the “Material Girl” singer, 62.</p><p>The Little Women actor, 25, opened up about dancing with Madonna during a November 2017 Sirius XM <a href=#>interview</a> with <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>.</p><p>“That was actually a really fun night,” he said. “[Lourdes] was there too, and we were all dancing together.”</p><p>When Cohen, 52, asked him how long he dated the Material Girl designer, however, he chose not to answer.</p><p>“Next question, I’m outta here,” Chalamet said.</p><p>While he was still an up-and-coming actor when he started dating Lourdes, the former high school sweethearts are now both helming successful careers. The trained dancer is the new face of Marc Jacobs, while the Call Me By Your Name star’s acting career is flourishing.</p><p>Although Lourdes, who is known as “Lola” to her friends, has nothing but nice things to say about her ex-boyfriend, both have moved on since their teenage romance.</p><p>Chalamet is <a href=#>rumored to be back together </a>with another A-list daughter, <a href=#><strong>Lily-Rose Depp</strong></a>, whose parents are <a href=#><strong>Johnny Depp</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Paradis</strong></a>.
