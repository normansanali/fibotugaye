To keep rats away from your home if you have a rodent issue in or near your home, use Bounce dryer sheets.

Place your dog food, cat food, and bird seed in a safe place. In the vicinity of the automobile, eliminate or block off rodent hiding areas.

Rats often have their weight and density working in their favour. The squirrel, on the other hand, will very certainly kill the rat if the two critters are nearly the same size, as I am certain. Squirrels will go for snakes on a frequent basis and with a lot of aggression.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Do dryer sheets have a repellent effect on squirrels?</h3><p>Photo courtesy of Donna Brok of the Garden Walk, Garden Talk blog.

Don’t give them anything to eat. They will come if you provide them with food. Take away the things that draw people in. Squirrels are attracted to the sight and smell of rotting fruit, nuts, and seeds. Scare the living daylights out of them. They should be sprayed. They should be excluded. Dissuade them.
