You would get invited to a “free” overnight stay or weekend getaway, the only catch being that you would have to sit in on a presentation about the property and then be pressured to buy. Today, fractional ownership has taken the place of the timeshare as a way to own vacation property. Is fractional ownership worth it?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">What is fractional property ownership?</h2><p>To determine whether fractional ownership is worth it, you have to learn more about what it is as well as the advantages and disadvantages. With fractional ownership, you own just a part, or fraction, of a property. You are one of several owners on the same property. There can be two part-owners or as many as 10 partial owners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marketrealist.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Fractional property ownership is different than timeshares because, with a timeshare, you own time that you can use at a property. With some timeshares, you’ll get the same week every year for your investment, while others will give you points that you can use at a number of different properties. Selling a timeshare is nearly impossible, which many people who got sucked into buying one eventually found out.</p><p>Purchasing a <a href=#>fractional share</a> of a property is a real estate transaction. Fractional ownership is primarily used in vacation properties because it offers a more affordable alternative to owning a <a href=#>vacation property</a> than if you were to own the whole property yourself. For example, a $1 million home on the beach may be out of your price range, especially for a vacation property that you would only use a limited amount of time each year. But if you were to buy a fraction of the property with five other investors, the $200,000 may be a more affordable price tag.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As with traditional homeownership, you’re responsible for the maintenance, utilities, and property taxes, but you are also only responsible for part of those costs as a fractional owner.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Does fractional ownership appreciate?</h2><p>Because fractional property ownership is a <a href=#>real estate</a> transaction, you would expect your investment to make money as the property appreciates, but unfortunately, that isn't the case. Fractional ownership rarely appreciates. Investing in a fractional property share should be considered a way to save money on vacationing rather than an investment that will make you money.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">What are the pros and cons of fractional property ownership?</h2><p>As with anything, there are pros and cons to fractional property ownership.
