He can play a romantic lead, like in “Being Mary Jane,” a psycho obsessed with a girl, like on “The Perfect Guy,” or a husband trying to protect his wife, as he did on his most recent film, “The Intruder.”</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>AN UNEXPECTED ANSWER</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>However, off-screen, Ealy is mostly known for his shy personality, polished speech, and collected demeanor.</p><p class=Zg>So, when he decided to <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/nKBhPz5dhVQ>open up</a> about the craziest thing he has ever done for love in an interview with Madame Noire, fans weren’t expecting the detailed tale that came out of his mouth.</p><p class=Zg>“The craziest thing I’ve ever done for love was stalk,” he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/nKBhPz5dhVQ>started</a>. “My girlfriend in college broke up with me, and I felt like she was gonna go back to her old boyfriend, so I kind of hung outside the apartment.”</p><p class=Zg>“I knew his car was there and the light was on in her room, and I just sat there waiting to go out. As if I was going to do something. […] I had a final the next day, and I didn’t sleep. And when the light went out, I think I probably cried a little bit, and for whatever reason, I just hoped it’d come right back on.”</p><p class=Zg>He stated he doesn’t remember anymore what happened next, but that was the craziest thing he’s ever done.</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>MOVING FROM THE CRAZINESS</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>Ealy overcame those college days and married actress <a class="zd d" href=#>Khatira Rafiqzada</a> in October 2012.

It’s not that just stop chasing your dreams; it’s just it doesn’t carry the same weight.”</p><p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>ON NEW PROJECTS</strong></h3></p><p class=Zg>The 45-year-old is currently making press rounds while promoting the film “The Intruder,” where he shares the screen with Meagan Good.</p><p class=Zg>They embody a young couple who buys their dream Napa Valley house and come face-to-face with danger after realizing the previous owner, played by Dennis Quaid, refuses to let go.</p><p class=Zg>Ealy is also working in another film from the same director of “The Intruder,” Deon Taylor, called “Fatale,” which is another thriller.</p><p class=Zg>“This is me and Hillary Swank and Mike Colter, and this one is beautiful, it’s a noir thriller.
