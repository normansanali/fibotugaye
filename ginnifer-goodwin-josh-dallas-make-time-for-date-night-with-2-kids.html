The couple also “FaceTime, like, 14 times a day.”</p><p>At the time, the Tennessee native said that she and Dallas didn’t have plans to add any more babies to their brood. “For now, I think we’re a foursome,” Goodwin said. “We’re at a good place.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When the pair first became parents, <a href=#>Dallas gushed about his new role</a>. “Every day is a milestone,” the Kentucky native told Us in 2015. “He can climb the stairs like a ninja . . . hold his own bottle. Every day there’s a milestone that amazes you as a parent. … Sleep is elusive — a slippery devil. I can’t seem to ever catch it. There’s somebody else that you have to take care of . . . you don’t think about yourself anymore. But it’s a pleasure to do that — he’s my little dude!”</p><p>As for Goodwin, the new mom praised her “knight in shining armor,” telling Us, “[My husband]&nbsp;also has not slept since mid-May. I’m always telling him, ‘You can sleep,’ but he won’t, he always helps.”</p><p>With reporting by Lindsay Hoffman</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGagoZ6jtqex0WaeqKeUrLavecmoqqFllJa5ra3SZqSao5Viwaq5xGadqKpdma61sYynoKCgpGLEqsDHZmlmo5mZwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
