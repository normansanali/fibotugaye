After an on-and-off romance, they <a href=#>went on to tie the knot in October 2002</a> and subsequently landed <a href=#>their own&nbsp;<i>Newlyweds&nbsp;</i>reality TV show</a>. After nearly four years of marriage, <a href=#>they ultimately called it quits</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It <a href=#>breaks my heart that I couldn’t make Jessica happy</a>. I wanted to be everything to my wife,” Lachey — who later married <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Lachey</strong></a> (née Minnillo)<a href=#> in July 2011</a> — recalled to&nbsp;<i>Rolling Stone&nbsp;</i>in April 2006. “I wanted her to look at me with love in her eyes, the way she did at the beginning, and have her feel like I was the most wonderful, awe-inspiring man on the planet. And when that stopped, it was the worst feeling in the world.”</p><p class=p1>The Texas native has been <a href=#>equally candid about their short-lived marriage</a>, even calling Nick her “first love” in h<a href=#>er&nbsp;<i>Open Book&nbsp;</i>memoir</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Nick loved the fact I was so strong in my faith and that I had this wide-eyed innocent approach to life. When he proposed in 2002, I said yes,” Simpson <a href=#>wrote in the book</a>, which was published in 2020. “We were young and pioneering our way through reality television, <a href=#>always mic’ed and always on</a>. We worked and we were great at it but when it came time to being alone, we weren’t great at it anymore.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “I was 22, and I had just pledged my life and destiny of this man. And I don’t regret it. Nick was meant to be my husband. No one else was <a href=#>supposed to have my virginity</a>.”</p><p class=p1>After their divorce was finalized in 2006,&nbsp; the&nbsp;<i>Employee of the Month&nbsp;</i>actress <a href=#>dated the likes of</a> <a href=#><strong>John Mayer</strong></a>,<a href=#><strong> Tony Romo</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Billy Corgan</strong></a>. Simpson went on to meet former football player <a href=#><strong>Eric Johnson</strong></a> in 2010, who <a href=#>proposed six months later</a> that November.</p><p class=p1>Simpson and <a href=#>the NFL alum</a> — who share <a href=#>daughters Maxwell, born in 2012, and Birdie, born in 2019, and son Ace, born in 2013</a> — <a href=#>wed in July 2014</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I don’t feel like&nbsp;our marriage has been long, but I feel like I’ve loved Eric my whole life,” Simpson <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in April 2022</a>. “I guess<a href=#> in the moment I met him, it felt like a marriage</a>. …&nbsp;Eric and I set intentions, and we’re very good at manifesting our dreams. We’re very good at <a href=#>creating a safe environment for each other</a> to be ourselves.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>She continued: “We rarely fight. If we do, it’s more conversational, and it’s not like, ‘He’s right or she’s right.’ It’s not about winning.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see Simpson’s complete dating history through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a%2F0qKamqtdoq6vxYymnKdlYmV%2BcYCXaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
