In 1982, KTLR 107.1 FM in Terrell, Texas, hired him to broadcast country music on weekends. KAAM 1310 AM in Dallas hired him as a part-time weekend radio jockey in 1983.</p><p>In 1986, he was hired part-time by the Satellite Music Network for an oldies format, and he later worked part-time for Z-Rock while still working at KAAM and KAFM.
