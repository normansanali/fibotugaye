The Friends star has a 12-year-old daughter, Marina, and thought that would score the ultimate “cool dad” points by taking her to a Taylor Swift concert and even getting up on stage with the pop star.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Taylor was nice enough to let us come backstage,” he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Conan O’Brien</a> on Tuesday night. “I went backstage and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Chris Rock</a> was there with his two little girls. So Taylor met all the girls and then she said, ‘Hey, you know, in one of my videos, the guy from my video is here and he’s the number one male model in the world. I want to introduce him on stage, and then I’d love it if you and Chris came up on stage, and I could introduce you guys as the number two and number three male models in the world.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had no idea it was coming. Chris and I looked at each other and he hadn’t shaved, you know, not really ready to go on stage at the Staples Center,” he joked, but said he felt obligated to help out Swift. Plus, maybe his daughter would think it was cool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’re like, ‘Whatever you need, Taylor, we’re here to help.’ So next thing I know, we’re underneath this stage,” LeBlanc says. “The model guy, he goes up first and then walks down this long catwalk. And Chris Rock and I are there and I remember just standing there looking at him underneath the stage and thinking, ‘Wow this is very bizarre. I’ve never worked with him before, don’t really know him that well.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We both look at each other and just kind of go, ‘Okay, just turn it up to 11 and act like a fool. Here we go. And it was kind of fun, just walk down the stage and dance.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Taylor Swift's Style Transformation</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the crowd of teenage girls was roaring, Marina was unimpressed. “The funniest part is, the next morning we’re having breakfast,” he told Conan. “And I say, so, your dad last night on stage with Taylor Swift. Pretty cool.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“And she goes, ‘Eh, I thought your walk was cheesy.’ Just puts it all in perspective.” Ugh, kids these days. Watch the hilarious video at top, plus the clip of LeBlanc strutting down Swift’s stage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGedlsG1ecuemaWZnph6prnBmqmrmaOotq%2BzjJ2YnWWklsatu9FmqrChlql6pLvNnJyrrA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
