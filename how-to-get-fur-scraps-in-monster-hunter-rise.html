At the Buddy Smith, you have the chance to construct armor for your Palico and your Palamute, two important party members you want to bring with you on any hunt when you’re lacking a few party members.</p><p data-injection=true>When speaking with the Buddy Smith, scroll down to the Scrap Swap option, and there will be multiple types of scraps you can exchange with them for Buddy Scraps. For example, you can swap out Warm Pelts and Bullfango Pelts for Fur Scraps. You can find Warm Pelts by defeating Kelbi and Anteka, which appear in multiple regions.
