Faamalele Malepeai was my spouse’s uncle, and his name was Faamalele. Please accept my heartfelt sympathies on behalf of his family. It would be greatly appreciated if you could accept them. This was the last picture that I took with you before we sat down to Christmas dinner with all of our extended family members. I’d want to take this opportunity to thank you for the warm smile you’ve always given me whenever we’ve seen each other, as well as the fact that I’ve never had the impression that I was an outsider at any of our family get-togethers.</p><p>I really appreciate both of these things, and I hope that we can continue to see each other in the future. I would want to express my gratitude to you for both of these aspects of the situation. When we eventually have the chance to meet up with all of our loved ones who have moved on to the next life, I believe beyond a reasonable doubt that it will be an experience that is nothing short of exciting for all of us. Regarding the topic, there isn’t even the tiniest shadow of a doubt in my head.</p><p>I want him to know that I am thinking about and praying for his wonderful wife Aunty Amelia Malepeai and all of his children as they are going through this difficult time. I also want him to know that I am thinking about him. I also want him to know that I am praying for him and will continue to think about him. In the midst of God’s eternal rest and serenity, it is my prayer that he will bestow upon you his perpetual peace and tranquility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwvNGom66bpGSTgH6RcmpubGNyxbLBwKScq7Gh</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
