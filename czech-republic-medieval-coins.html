Curious about their potential importance, she contacted officials.</p><p>Then, archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic arrived and began searching the area with metal detectors. In total, they unearthed more than 2,150 silver coins as well as broken remnants of a ceramic container that likely once held the money.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-491850 alt="Archaeologists Search Field" width=900 height=563 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/archaeologists-search-field.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-491850 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic</span><span class=caption-body>Archaeologists scour the field with metal detectors.</span></p><p>In a <a href=# rel=noopener>press release</a>, the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences stated that the coins were made up of an “alloy, which, in addition to silver, also contains an admixture of copper, lead, and trace metals. Determining this particular composition can also help determine the origin of the silver used.”</p><p>So, why exactly were these coins buried in a remote field?</p><h2>Where Did The Silver Coins Come From?</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-491847 alt="Coin Survey" width=900 height=563 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/coin-survey.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-491847 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic</span><span class=caption-body>The silver coins lying in the dirt.</span></p><p>After analyzing the coins, researchers determined that they were likely minted by Bohemian rulers King Vratislav II and princes Břetislav II, and Bořivoje II between 1085 and 1107.</p><p>Lenka Mazačová, the director of the Czech Silver Museum in Kutná Hora, further stated in the press release, “The coins were likely minted in the Prague mint from silver, which was imported to Bohemia at the time.”</p><p>As for how the coins ended up in the dirt, experts believe that their wealthy owner likely buried them during a time of political instability.</p><p>“At that time, there were disputes in the country between the members of the Přemysl dynasty about the princely throne of Prague,” institute archaeologist Filip Velímský stated in the press release. The coins could have been used “for paying wages or spoils of war.”</p><p>Regardless of their use, the coins are one of the most important archaeological finds in the region in the last 10 years.</p><p>“Unfortunately, for the turn of the 11th to 12th century, we lack data on the purchasing power of contemporary coins,” Velímský continued. “But it was a huge, unimaginable — and at the same time, unavailable — amount for an ordinary person. It can be compared to winning a million in the jackpot.”</p><p>Currently, researchers are working to register each of the coins into a database. Then, they plan on using X-ray imaging to determine their composition. After that, the coins will be available for public viewing as early as next year.</p><p>After reading about the medieval silver coins found in the Czech Republic, dive into the story of <a href=#>the Defenestration of Prague</a> in 1618.
