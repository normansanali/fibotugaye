With catchy singles “I Wanna Love You Forever” and “I Think I’m In Love With You,” the record sold close to two million copies. Simpson’s younger sister, <a href=#><strong>Ashlee</strong></a>, served as one of her backup dancers before launching her own career as an actress and musician.</p><p>Simpson began dating 98 Degrees singer <a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong></a> in 1998 after meeting at a party, and Lachey was even featured on her first album. The pair got engaged in February 2002, tying the knot later that year in Austin, Texas. The couple became the subject of MTV reality series, Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica, which turned them into one of America’s most recognizable (and scrutinized) couples. Simpson and Lachey separated in November 2005, and their divorce was finalized in July 2006.</p><p>Since the success of her debut album, Simpson has released six more studio albums. Her 2003 album, In This Skin, was released in tandem with Newlyweds and was the best-selling effort of her career.</p><p>Following her split from Lachey, Simpson revealed in August 2006 that she was dating <a href=#><strong>John Mayer</strong></a>. The couple’s on-off relationship officially ended in June 2007 after eight months.</p><p>In November 2007, Simpson started dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback <a href=#><strong>Tony Romo</strong></a>. He broke up with her the following July on the night before her 29th birthday. In December 2009, Simpson briefly dated Smashing Pumpkins frontman <a href=#><strong>Billy Corgan</strong></a> before moving on with former NFL player <a href=#><strong>Eric Johnson</strong></a>.</p><p>Simpson and Johnson welcomed daughter Maxwell Drew on May 1, 2012, and son Ace Knute on June 30, 2013. The couple wed in 2014, nearly five years before welcoming daughter Birdie Mae on March 20, 2019.</p><p>Her New York Times best-selling memoir, Open Book, was released in 2020. The book shares intimate details about her career, past relationships and issues with abuse and body image.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnmprAtLXCmmSsoZ2lwLC6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
