I don’t think he actually knows what it means! I think he wants a sibling his age, which would be interesting. But we’ll see.”</p><p>The Billions star shares Sebastian with<a href=#> her ex-husband, <strong>Robert Zincone</strong></a>. Four years after their 2013 split, <a href=#>Åkerman married <strong>Jack Donnelly</strong></a>. The pair have considered having a child of their own, the model&nbsp;told Us exclusively in March.</p><p>“It’s always in the conversation, but we don’t know the answer to it yet,” the Childrens Hospital&nbsp;alum told Us at the time. “It’s a big responsibility, but of course, it’s a beautiful vision, and we’ll see what happens.”</p><p>For now, the Stockholm, Sweden, native is focused on raising her son as eco-consciously as she can. “He’s all about recycling,” Åkerman told Us on Thursday. “We have a compost, we have a garden. He yells at people in bathrooms for using paper and thinks they’re killing the trees. He won’t use straws anymore. I mean, [he’s a] really conscious little beings, which makes me really happy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She and the Atlantis alum aren’t just teaching the little one about eco-friendly practices at home, but they’ve also modeled a healthy, compassionate relationship for him since their December 2018 nuptials.</p><p>“We have the same love language because he’s grown up like that,” Åkerman&nbsp;told Us in March. “I think compared to his friends, some parents aren’t as … <a href=#>public with their displays of affection</a> as me and my husband are and how I am with him, so sometimes [Sebastian’s friends] react like, ‘Wow! Your mom and dad kiss a lot.’ And he’s like, ‘Yeah! Don’t yours?’”</p><p>With reporting by Emily Marcus</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGammZyeu26typ6pppmeYryvecGambJlnqR6c3nMsmSsp55ixKK606xkmmWjnq%2Bttc2gZKGho2KuqLGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
