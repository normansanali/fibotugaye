Mom told everyone I wanted a boy. Not true, I’m a #girldad. You came at the right time when our family needed you the most and for that I will always be grateful.”</p><p>The Italy native, who also shares Gia, 19, Gabriella, 15, and Milania, 14, with his ex-wife,<a href=#><strong> Teresa Giudice</strong></a>, went on to write, “I have to say YOU all don’t know this but I am challenged by you girls to always be better. You all encourage me to fight harder. Your life has given me breath in so many ways. You teach me the importance of love and I am thankful for that <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a>. Thank you for always being patient with me. Thank you for always loving me so unconditionally. Thank you for all your kisses and hugs still remember and miss them. Thank you for exceeding every expectation in school, dance, and for just being you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Joe-Guidice-Teared-Up-Wishing-His-and-Teresa-Giudices-Daughter-Audrina-Happy-11th-Birthday.jpg><p>Teresa, also 48, shared a touching tribute to their youngest daughter too. “Happy Birthday Audriana!!
