Given that Sajak has been the show’s primary host for over 40 seasons, it’s clear that the ever-popular game show will experience significant changes — including the recent announcement that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Seacrest will be replacing Sajak</a> as host.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Fans online have since been scratching their heads and puzzled as to why <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanna White</a></strong> — the long-standing hostess of the show — was not selected to become the new host. Not only that, but fans around the country are understandably irate after learning that White, who has truly become a staple of the game show, hasn’t received a pay increase in nearly two decades.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>Due to the lack of pay increase, White has reportedly hired attorney Bryan Freedman, citing that “a possible gender discrimination” is the reason behind White not receiving a raise in almost twenty years.</p><h2 id=h-how-much-does-white-make-on-wheel-of-fortune data-injectable=false>How much does White make on Wheel of Fortune?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Vanna-White-Pat-Sajak.png><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>As it stands, Puck.news reported that White earns $3 million annually for her work on Wheel of Fortune. On the other side of the bruised coin, Forbes reported back in 2016 that co-host Pat Sajak earns $15 million a year for his work on the game show — a fact that undoubtedly gives White some serious room for disagreement.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Despite the noticeable difference in pay between the two hosts, Celebrity Net Worth reports that White’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth</a> is $85 million, while Sajak’s net worth is $75 million. Nevertheless, the two hosts have remained extremely fond of each other over the years, and even wished each other well in separate Twitter posts.</p><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=610 data-injectable=false>But with Seacrest set to join the show for its 42nd season, here’s hoping that a new deal is discussed and eventually worked out for White, who is extremely deserving of a pay increase after decades of work on the game show which has remained in the public spotlight for a long while now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TDorrNmmSwoJmpsrR51qGcnqRdpLNuss6rq66mlWLAorjAq7BmnailuaK1zZ6baA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
