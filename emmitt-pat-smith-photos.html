Before they got together, Pat was married to Martin Lawrence, and they had a daughter, Jasmine, together, while Emmitt was in a relationship with Hope Wilson, who he shares a daughter, Rheagan, with. Emmitt and Pat welcomed their first son, Emmitt Jr., in 2002, followed by a daughter, Skylar, in 2003. Their son, Elijah, was born in Sept. 2010. In April 2020, Elijah and Pat celebrated 20 years of marriage, and she honored the occasion by gushing over her husband in a lengthy Instagram post about the strength of their marriage after so many years. So, it was quite shocking to fans when Emmitt and Pat announced that they had separated just three months later. The news broke at the beginning of August 2020 when the pair released a joint statement confirming the state of their relationship.
