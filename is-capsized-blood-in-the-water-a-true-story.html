The 31st season of the annual program kicked off on Discovery Channel on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET. And while the live footage is usually what I anticipate most, one TV movie, Capsized: Blood in the Water, has caught my attention.</p><p>Most of the TV movies during Shark Week tend to be far-fetched, but this one seems particularly realistic. So in case you're wondering if Capsized: Blood in the Water is&nbsp;a true story, brace yourself —&nbsp;it's based on real-life events.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the true story behind Capsized: Blood in the Water?</h2><p>Capsized: Blood in the Water happens to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery's first full feature film</a> to debut during the intriguing (yet completely terrifying) week-long program, according to NBC.&nbsp;</p><p>And despite the fact the movie screams Hollywood (I mean — really — it stars Josh Duhamel), the film was apparently based on some seriously wild real-life events.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The movie is based on a tragedy that occurred in 1982. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">National Post</a>, it all started when a boat owner hired a crew to bring his yacht, 'Trashman' to his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. from Portland, Maine. However, it capsized during a storm and sunk off the coast of North Carolina by Morehead City.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The area is an infamous home to sharks, and though the crew crammed into a lifeboat, many were bleeding from injuries incurred from the storm. The lifeboat was soon surrounded by tiger sharks.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The crew was stranded for a total of 18 hours, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Popular Mechanics</a>, Two crew members, Captain John Lippoth and his friend, Mark Adams, had been consistently drunk during the excursion.&nbsp;</p><p>They drank seawater and soon became incoherent and went overboard. The captain's girlfriend ended up dying from blood poisoning, and had to be thrown overboard.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, only two crew members, Deborah Scaling Kiley and Brad Cavanagh, survived. They were eventually rescued by a Soviet cargo freighter.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Popular Mechanics</a>,&nbsp;Deborah and Brad were unable to do much after the storm. They lost most of their food, water, and supplies.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, seeing as the captain was consistently drunk and apparently afraid of the ocean, he wasn't an incredibly helpful asset.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Capsized: Blood in the Water trailer</a> was officially released on Shark Week's Twitter account last week. It depicts the story of the stranded crew, and how they tried their best to survive in a lifeboat without supplies, while being hunted by tiger sharks.&nbsp;</p><p>Definitely watch it if you haven't already, below.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Like I said, the Shark Week feature film stars Josh Duhamel (so it's bound to be a beautiful time), as well as Tyler Blackburn, and Beau Garrett.&nbsp;</p><p>You will officially be able to watch it as of July 31 at 9 p.m. ET on the Discovery Channel. Oh, and don't worry —&nbsp;it's a no-life-jacket-required viewing party... just make sure you remember to keep all of your emotions in check. Sharks can smell fear, you know.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBur8CpqqKylZl6o7jOqJtmoZ5iwamxjLCYrZ2iYq5uwNGunGarpKS%2Fug%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
