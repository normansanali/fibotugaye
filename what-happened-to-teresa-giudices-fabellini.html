Giudice was busy with promoting her line of Prosecco on Twitter in 2012, offering fans the <a href=#>chance</a> for a tasting and autograph in the tri-state area. She was one busy gal, showing up at liquor stores and events so that fans could come get a taste.</p><p dir=ltr>This all came to a halt when Giudice was sentenced to prison for fraud, and began her term in early 2014, per <a href=#>People</a>. The negative publicity took a huge toll on Giudice's growing brand. She spoke on <a href=#>"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"</a>&nbsp;after she was out of prison. Cohen asked if her enterprises were hurt by her sentence. "Oh, it did," she said. "Pretty much all my businesses went to s**t with this whole legal thing. They did." At the time though, Giudice was optimistic that things could turn around for Fabellini. "So I have to rebuild now," she told Cohen. "Listen, we all fall down, and we've just got to pick ourselves back up." But this didn't end up being the case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlhZ4Rzg46wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkerWx0Z6qmmWXnsKltcKeqmaekZeyrbjIp6Bo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
