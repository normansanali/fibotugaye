The new reality TV series focuses on Leva Bonaparte and the staff of her restaurant, Republic Garden & Lounge.</strong></p><p>One of the staff members is Joe Bradley, the nightclub’s VIP host. His responsibility is to bring in VIP visitors and ensure that they have a good time in the Republic. Joe is originally from Atlanta, Georgia, and is currently attempting to make a name for himself in the Charleston hotel industry (South Carolina).</p><p>According to his LinkedIn page, he studied art and design as well as communications at the University of Michigan from 2014 to 2018. According to his official profile on Bravo’s website, he dropped out of college and began working in entry-level positions.</p><h2>Joe Bradley also works in the textile and furniture industries</h2><p>On Southern Hospitality, Joe Bradley will play one of Leva Bonaparte’s employees. He is a VIP host at Republic Garden & Lounge, the restaurant/nightclub owned by the Southern Charm star. Joe’s experience in hospitality is not listed on his LinkedIn profile. According to his LinkedIn, he has been working full-time for the premium furniture and textile brand BRADLEY.</p><p>In September 2019, he started working for the company as a sales professional. Prior to that, he worked for RAM Partners LLC as a sales and leasing representative and for LA Fitness as a sales counselor. His official profile on Bravo’s website, on the other hand, tells a different story. He was a college dropout who now aspires to be a restaurant owner like his boss, Leva.</p><p>According to Joe’s bio:</p><p><strong>“Joe Bradley has always felt he had a lot to live up to, coming from a wealthy Atlanta family.” After dropping out of college and working a series of entry-level jobs, he discovered his passion as a VIP Host at Republic. Joe wants to be the next Leva, a restaurant and nightlife tycoon. Despite his efforts to demonstrate his managerial potential, his coworkers remind him that he is not the boss.”</strong></p><p>On Southern Hospitality, Joe will be seen sparring with nine other co-stars. In a teaser, Mikel Simmons was shown tossing a drink in Joe’s face, while Maddi Reese implored Joe to “be a man.” Joe admitted to Maddi in one of the trailers that he felt feelings for her.</p><p>Maddi, on the other hand, was in a relationship with another teaser character. Joe was warned to keep his distance from Maddi or they would have a “real problem.”</p><h2>More details on Southern Hospitality</h2><p>Bravo is planning a spin-off of Southern Charm called Southern Hospitality, starring Leva Bonaparte. It will be her show, and fans are welcome to join her in both her professional and personal lives. She and her husband, Lamar Bonaparte, own a number of restaurants in Charleston. The staff of the nightclub will be the focal point of Southern Hospitality, which will focus on the Republic Garden & Lounge.</p><p>The official synopsis for Southern Hospitality season 1 is as follows:</p><p><strong>“Southern Charm resident boss-lady Leva Bonaparte oversees Charleston’s very own “it” crowd, aka her larger-than-life crew at Republic Garden & Lounge.” Leva and her husband, Lamar, own four restaurants on King Street, but Republic is their crown jewel.”</strong></p><p>The Bravo show’s cast includes Leva, Joe Bradley, Mikel Simmons, Grace Lilly, Mia Alario, Will Kulp, Emmy Sharrett, TJ Dinch, Luca Pea, Maddi Reese, and Bradley Carter. Season 1 of Southern Hospitality premieres on Monday, November 28, 2022, at 9:00 p.m. ET.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Douglas Joseph Warren</a></h3>Scroll below and check our most recent updates about Douglas Joseph Warren's Estimated Net Worth, Age, Biography, Career, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki.
