But with the first official trailer for part-one of Netflixâ€™s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">You</a></strong> season 4 dropping earlier today, the tables have unexpectedly turned for the seriesâ€™ opinion-splitting character. Thatâ€™s right, folks â€” Joe is in big trouble this time.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>In the fresh-faced trailer, thrill-seeking subscribers learn that Joe is now the one with a target on his back and being stalked by a similar, yet completely mysterious predator. Of course, diehard fans understand that this certainly isnâ€™t the first time that Joe has found himself in such a testing predicament, seeing as the character was stalked by ex-girlfriend Candace in season 2. But now, fans are more than thrilled to witness Joe under the hot seat and experience the same stress that he has caused so many others in the past.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imma tap back in just to watch him go through hell ikdr <a href=#>https://t.co/hOcsLxaOFt</a></p>â€” morningstar âœ­ (@jupitersembrace) <a href=#>January 9, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tables turn the tables turned what goes around comes back arounddd <a href=#>https://t.co/DFzUfmVUkx</a></p>â€” HEEDlE (@heyheedie) <a href=#>January 9, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>oooh its actually gonna get interesting <a href=#>https://t.co/vBIdwd43bS</a></p>â€” ZAYNAðŸ”Ž#ANDAMOVIE (@sitcomabed) <a href=#>January 9, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>he deserves worse soo. good for him <a href=#>https://t.co/E1bsZhBRcp</a></p>â€” tafara ðŸª¼ (@miightymorphin) <a href=#>January 9, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>Unsurprisingly, a large handful of stans are now completely convinced that Joeâ€™s wife, Love Quinn, is going to make a huge return to the series. In fact, folks remain adamant that Love is the one stalking Joe, and that she has a strong dose of revenge firmly planted in her mind. And considering the devious acts that Joe has committed time and time again in the past, it only makes sense that Love would return to serve up some justice.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>That, or perhaps Jenna Ortega is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cooking up a triumphant return</a> to the series that saw her come face-to-face with Joe numerous times, only to never be harmed by the character. Until then, all questions will be answered when part-one of You season 4 arrives on Netflix on Feb. 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdOfo6KwXajCo7%2FCq6CbnaKoeqK%2BxGaqoaeToLKledOoZKWdkae7bsDHmqtmsZ%2Bqeqmt0marmqOVo3qiedKuqamqmai2r7OMrayrpl2eu26%2BxKCYq5yjYsGwecBmnZqmXZuut7vRoqueZZOdrrOtwq2cq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
