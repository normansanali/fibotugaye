It’s one of the best shows of its ilk on the air these days, and that consistency in quality recently earned the show another renewal. Fresh off the heels of a broadly successful season 5, we have confirmation that The Rookie is headed back for a season 6. Here’s what to expect from the next season’s cast, storyline, and more.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>When might The Rookie season 6 release?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>Season 5 of The Rookie arrived on screens in September of 2022, but — despite its broad popularity — it took more than six months for the show to cinch a renewal. Thankfully, that renewal did eventually come around —&nbsp;in April of 2023 — but word on when the next season will drop is still out.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=637 data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true>Based on previous seasons, we can estimate when season six of The Rookie will likely release, but there’s a major caveat attached. Previous seasons of the show have largely dropped in the fall — typically in September — with the COVID-19 pandemic throwing in a wrench that threw off that trend. With that in mind, we’d typically estimate that season six will hit screens between September and October, but that’s not likely this year. Due to the WGA and SAG strikes, The Rookie is likely to see a pretty major delay. As such, we predict audiences won’t be getting their hands on season six until mid-2024 — at the earliest.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Rookie season 6 cast</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nathan Fillion (@nathanfillion)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>Thankfully, despite those aforementioned strikes, it seems the same cast we know and love will be returning to The Rookie for season 6. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Series lead Nathan Fillion</a> already <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed his return</a> with a joyful Instagram post, and the rest of the star-studded cast is expected to join him on set once the strikes conclude (hopefully with each of the demands met). Among the top-billed cast we’re looking forward to in season 6 are Melissa O’Neill, Eric Winter, Alyssa Diaz, Mekia Cox, and — hopefully — Tru Valentino.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Rookie season 6 plot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The_Rookie_cast.jpg><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=true>It’s hard to say exactly what fans can expect from The Rookie’s season 6 plot, but the show’s been laying down breadcrumbs we can follow to a fair estimation. Season 5 set up a harrowing plot, much of which has yet to be explored. We can bet that season 6 will dig deep into the man behind season 5’s red herring, played by Kristian Bruun, and (hopefully) answer some burning fan questions in the process.</p><h2 id=h-the-rookie-spin-offs data-injectable=false>The Rookie spin-offs</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=false>That’s not all! On top of a stacked cast, thrilling plot, and upcoming season 6, The Rookie also boasts a spin-off. The show inspired a federal spin-off titled The Rookie: Feds, which debuted back in September of 2022. The spin-off features <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Niecy Nash</a> in the lead role, alongside Frankie Faison, James Lesure, and Britt Robertson, to name a few.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmqainm56ybr%2FEmqqopl1rerOxy56YrJ1drLavsM6wZJyZo6l6sbjOrWSappRiurC%2BxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
