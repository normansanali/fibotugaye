The Black Dog variant even included a lyric on the back, which read, “Old habits die screaming,” which connected back to Swift’s <a href=#>depression playlist that she created</a> ahead of TTPD’s release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Joe-Alwyn-2-Is-The-Black-Dog-From-Taylor-Swift-The-Tortured-Poets-Department-a-Real-Place.jpg><p>However, there is a bar called <a href=# rel=noopener>The Black Dog Freehouse</a> in Vauxhall, which is located in Alwyn’s native England. Fans have already started leaving comments on the pub’s Instagram posts and The Black Dog Freehouse social media has also been having fun by promoting Swift’s music on their official account. Their Instagram bio now reads, “Pub, restaurant & beer garden 🎶Home to tortured poets @taylorswift.”</p><p>“The Black Dog” is not the only track that made references to life in England. Swift also released a track titled “So Long, London,” which offered <a href=#>a glimpse into her breakup</a> from Alwyn, 33. The former couple started dating in 2017 and occasionally collaborated on her music before calling it quits.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in April 2023 that Swift and Alwyn <a href=#>parted ways due to their romance</a> being too high-profile.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Joe-Alwyn-3-Is-The-Black-Dog-From-Taylor-Swift-The-Tortured-Poets-Department-a-Real-Place.jpg><p>“Joe is very shy and never liked all of the attention that came with dating one of the most popular singers in the world,” a source told Us before noting that Swift wasn’t at “fault” for the breakup. “[Joe] just didn’t like having to be on all of the time.”</p><p>Swift moved on with ex <strong>Matt Healy</strong> — who <a href=#>appeared to be the main inspiration for TTPD</a> — but their connection quickly fizzled out. She has since been dating boyfriend <strong>Travis Kelce</strong>, who she went public with late last year.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In February, Swift <a href=#>announced the release of her 11th album</a> at the 2024 Grammy Awards, saying, “[The way I can celebrate my Grammys win] is by telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the past two years, which is that my brand new album comes out April 19th. It’s called The Tortured Poets Department and I’m going to go post the cover right now backstage.”</p><p>Devoted Swifties subsequently pointed out that Alwyn previously talked about <a href=#>having a group chat with a similar name</a>, which featured <strong>Paul Mescal </strong>and<strong> Andrew Scott</strong>.</p><p>“It’s the Tortured Man Club, I think. It’s me, you — and Andrew Scott started the group,” Alwyn said during Variety’s Actors on Actors interview special in December 2022. “[Andrew is] just messaging himself good mornings. We were both in the Sally Rooney universe and crossed over with Lenny Abrahamson. We were so lucky to have that experience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XuaKvymabqJ9dm7%2BwuYytmLKkn6d6tMPIn6usZaSpvaV5yKxkmmWimq6tecGaqWahnmK5sLrDqKVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
