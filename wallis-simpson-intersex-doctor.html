As a result, they are infertile.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"There are several prominent actresses today in America -- I can't reveal their names -- who have CAIS," said Spack. "They are mothers with adopted children and they are women, of course."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">These women can have sexual intercourse and they also report normal sensation, because nerve endings are still present.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">And, according to Spack, "CAIS girls hardly ever struggle with gender identity problems."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Children with CAIS have a mutation in the androgen receptor gene that makes it impossible for the body to deliver testosterone to the developing fetus.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The genetic defect is carried in the mother's X chromosome and passed on to 50 percent of their male children, who "come out looking female," according to Spack.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In the first six to seven weeks of gestation, the genital area is undifferentiated. "There is no difference between the sexes," he said. "The structures can go either way."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Male hormones stimulate the tissue to form a phallus, seminal vesicles and sperm ducts, rather than a clitoris, uterus and Fallopian tubes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCUxJqjraBfrK6tuMisZKyhnaXAsLqMoqWtnaKosrl5w6iaraeiZMC1u9GydqKcbWaCdoCVcm1w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
