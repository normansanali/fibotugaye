"She ran up to Mickey. She sang with Moana, I sang with Moana, it was amazing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Perry, Daisy has already had many interactions with her favorite Disney characters. She's been to Disneyland Tokyo and even celebrated Christmas with the big man Mickey Mouse himself last year. "You know, I think it's subliminal," Perry joked. "I accidentally named my daughter after Daisy Duck."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perry's fiancé <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bloom also recently opened up about their daughter</a> in an interview with People. The actor gushed about their daughter, saying she is growing up fast. "She's beautiful, she's growing fast, big, strong and healthy," he said. "And you can't be more blessed than that."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the show's stint in Hawaii, the three judges (Perry, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie) are joined by Noah Cyrus&nbsp;and singer Allen Stone as mentors for the remaining contestants. After attempting to narrow down the competition to 24, Perry shares that the trio fought to have a top 26 instead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"More new talent is born every day and it's 26 because we literally could not pare it down," she said. "We added two more because we were like, asking all the producers, 'Is this OK? Is this like, can we really do this? I know you guys have done this for 21 seasons, but we have really good talent. We can't send these people home.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrsmWgmr%2BzxYyapJ6qmZiur3nInaalZZiWxKK1yGabmq2XncGmvoydmKKrqWKxqr%2FNnrBmqpWovLPAjHBrcHFobX8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
