Now, Clark is reflecting on his time in WWE.&nbsp;</span><span>Speaking on the <a href=#>Shining Wizards podcast</a>, Clark discussed his return, his original run, and more. Below are some highlights sent by the team from the podcast:</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve told this story before.&nbsp;&nbsp;They offered me two different gimmicks, and I’ve told people if they don’t believe me, go to the trademark commission and look it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they had the Adam Bomb trademark and The Ringmaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose Adam Bomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just felt I could do a lot more with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, like you said, very colorful.&nbsp;&nbsp;[The character] had a lot of potential I felt at the time.</p><p>:&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a couple people say that, but I never did hear it because prior to that, we were on a European Tour and I worked with Earthquake for like ten nights in a row preparing for Mania.&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s sort of the way they did it at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had like a 15 minute match worked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;A damn good match actually.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m hearing Ludvig Borga stuff now, but I think he may have left or got terminated prior, maybe in January prior to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;We started working all those nights prior too in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Germany and UK, but again I can’t quite pinpoint the date.</p><p>&nbsp;It was just Kronik, and Brian (Adams) wanted to go a lot more than I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;I told Brian, and we talked about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought we should go to Japan right away.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was friends with ‘Taker so he thought maybe we should go back to Vince.&nbsp;&nbsp;We both left there and we always had that unsettling heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;We just felt like, and I even felt like – and he did once we&nbsp;got there – that this was not a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;They did a hotshot of an angle, but Kane had a big staph infection and I think Taker had a shoulder injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had basically a broken neck and we were all just banged up.&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t give us the time, and I said “hey, let’s go on the road for a little bit and get a feel for each other versus just hot-shotting it.”&nbsp; It fell apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we went to All-Japan like I suggested from the beginning.</p><p>http://show.shiningwizards.com/shining-wizards/episode-546-dropping-bombs-roks/</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFuZ2xpZ2Kvs8XAp2ScpJGnuG67zWafoqtdlrGiuYybpqaaXafCr3nAp5tmr6eaerOx066pp2WZo3pzfI9q</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
