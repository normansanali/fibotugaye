Discovered in amber in a cave in Myanmar, they’ve been named Crenocticola svadba and Mulleriblattina bowangi. Both are part of the Nocticolidae family and officially 99 million years old.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Phys</a>, their remarkable age places them squarely in the Cretaceous period — when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. The specimen were found in deposits from a Hukawng Valley mine, which have been used for several, unrelated studies in recent years.</p><p>This prehistoric surprise came after researchers were given 110 tons of amber to study. Prior experts had already dated the amber by dating the mine’s volcanic rocks, though nobody quite expected to find anything as old and well-preserved as this.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Published in the Gondwana Research journal</a>, the findings represent “the only known dinosaur age cave survivors.” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to LiveScience</a>, the “exquisitely preserved” cave-dwelling cockroaches have already rewritten history, as they were thought to only date back to 65 million years — until now.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-267152 alt="Photos Of The Ancient Myanmar Cockroaches" width=800 height=732 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photos-of-the-ancient-myanmar-cockroaches.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-267152 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Lenka Podstrelená, Sendi et al.

It’s unclear how they were trapped in amber, but researchers believe tree roots that burrowed into the cave and dripped resin inside were responsible.</p><p>They also believe these cockroaches likely ate dinosaur guano, or excrement, just as modern cockroaches feed on bird and bat droppings. How they survived the apocalyptic extinction event that killed the planet’s dinosaur population remains unclear, though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cockroaches are famously resilient</a>.</p><p>“Cave environments are well suited for fossilization of bones and coprolites [or fossilized feces] and the fossil record of cave mammals includes rodents, ungulates, marsupials, ursids, felids, hyaenids, canids, primates and humans,” the study explained.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-267154 alt="Microscopic Cockroach Anatomy" width=900 height=556 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/microscopic-cockroach-anatomy.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-267154 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Lenka Podstrelená, Sendi et al.

It’s unclear if the theory of how they were embedded in amber is accurate, but one thing is clear: jokes about cockroaches surviving an apocalypse just might be truer than we realized.</p><p>After learning about the two new species of ancient cockroach discovered trapped in amber in a Myanmar cave, read about <a href=#>the family of cockroaches found living inside of a man’s ear</a>.
