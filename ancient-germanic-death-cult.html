Furthermore, the tomb is surrounded by 40 to 60 other graves.

But maybe his ashes are in the bronze cauldron,” said archaeologist Susanne Friederich from the State Museum of Prehistory in Halle, the archaeological museum of the German state of Saxony-Anhalt.</p><p>Researchers suspect the central burial was built on a mounded tomb with the outer individual graves added around it later on. Although it’s too early to determine why the six women encircling the cauldron were buried as they were, there are a number of possible explanations.</p><p>The women could have been concubines or devotees of the deceased lord. But researchers have yet to determine how the women died, which could point to whether they were involuntarily sacrificed or if they willingly killed themselves to accompany the lord in death as in some sort of cult.</p><p>So far, estimates of when the burial site was created range sometime between 480 AD and 530 AD. That means the burial would have been around the time of the fall of the Roman Empire, which led many Germanic tribes to invade former Roman territories.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-298309 alt="Ancient Vestment Clasp" width=900 height=480 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ancient-vestment-clasp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-298309 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>DPA/PA Images</span><span class=caption-body>An elaborate vestment clasp, which include pieces of snagged textile, are thought to indicate the cemetery’s Germanic ties.</span></p><p>Archaeologists have also uncovered a bevy of remarkable artifacts inside the burial complex. Among the most notable were an array of elaborately detailed vestment clasps, which researchers say indicate the presence of a Germanic tribe, a sword and shield made of iron, and a gold coin featuring the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno, who lived sometime around 480 AD.</p><p>They also uncovered a small figurine believed to be shaped in the form of a Germanic god and estimated to be even older than the tomb itself, possibly dating back 1,800 years ago.</p><p>“The unique finds suggest that higher-ranking personalities have been buried here,” Friederich said of the fantastic pieces found at the excavation site. Given the valuable findings at the site, it’s very fortunate that it had not been ransacked by looters trying to make a quick buck.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-298307 alt="Germanic God Statue" width=600 height=822 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/germanic-god-statue.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-298307 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>DPA/PA Images</span><span class=caption-body>This Germanic god statue is thought to be around 1,800 years old and was buried with its owner at the site.</span></p><p>Researchers think the tomb was protected from looters by its location in a natural hollow that became covered in Earth over the passing millennia.
