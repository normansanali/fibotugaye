respirando<br><i>[Translation of Spanish:]</i> listen to it.. the city breathing</p><p>woman <i>[repeats 3x]</i></p><p><i>[Spanish speaking woman]</i> escuchela..</p><p><i>[Mos Def]</i><br>The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis<br>Shinin’, like who on top of this?<br>People was tusslin’, arguin’ and bustlin’<br>Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustlin’<br>I’m wrestlin’ with words and ideas<br>My ears is picky, seekin’ what will transmit<br>The scribes can apply to transcript, yo<br>This ain’t no time where the usual is suitable<br>Tonight alive, let’s describe the inscrutable<br>The indisputable, we New York the narcotic<br>Strength in metal and fiber optics<br>Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips<br>For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets<br>Hard knuckles on the second hands of workin’ class watches<br>Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living<br>Is preposterous, stay alive, you play or die, no options<br>No Batman and Robin, can’t tell between<br>The cops and the robbers, they both partners, they all heartless<br>With no conscience, back streets stay darkened<br>Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened<br>My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbin’<br>You either make a way or stay sobbin’, the shiny apple<br>Is bruised but sweet and if you choose to eat<br>You could lose your teeth, many crews retreat<br>Nightly news repeat, who got shot down and locked down<br>Spotlight to savages, Nasdaq averages<br>My narrative, rose to explain this existence<br>Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance</p><p>So much on my mind that I cant recline<br>Blastin’ holes in the night till she bled sunshine<br>Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine<br>Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline<br>Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call<br>I cant take it y’all, I can feel the city breathin’<br>Chest heavin’, against the flesh of the evening<br>Sigh before we die like the last train leaving</p><p><i>[Talib Kweli]</i><br>Breathin’ in deep city breaths, sittin’ on shitty steps<br>We stoop to new lows, hell froze the night the city slept<br>The beast crept through concrete jungles<br>Communicatin’ with one another<br>And ghetto birds where waters fall<br>From the hydrants to the gutters<br>The beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin’<br>You on the wrong side of the track, lookin’ visibly shaken<br>Taken them plungers, plungin’ to death thats painted by the numbers<br>With crime unapplied pressure, cats is playin’ god<br>But havin’ children by a lesser baby mother but fuck it<br>We played against each other like puppets, swearin’ you got pull<br>When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes<br>Gettin’ knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise<br>Look in the skies for god, what you see besides the smog<br>Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene<br>Thoughts that people put in the air<br>Places where you could get murdered over a glare<br>But everything is fair<br>Its a paradox we call reality<br>So keepin’ it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality<br>Killers born naturally like, Mickey and Mallory<br>Not knowing the ways’ll get you capped like an NBA salary<br>Some cats be emceeing to illustrate what we be seeing<br>Hard to be a spiritual being when shit is shakin’ what you believe in<br>For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted<br>I’m asking if y’all feel me and the crowd left me stranded<br>My blood pressure boiled and rose, cause New York niggas<br>Actin’ spoiled at shows, to the winners the spoils go<br>I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates<br>New York life type trife the Roman Empire State</p><p><i>[Mos Def and crew]</i><br>So much on my mind I just can’t recline<br>Blastin’ holes in the night till she bled sunshine<br>Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine<br>Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline<br>Yo don’t the bass ride out like an ancient mating call<br>I cant take it y’all, I can feel the city breathin’<br>Chest heavin’, against the flesh of the evening<br>Sigh before we die like the last train leaving</p><p><i>[Spanish speaking woman]</i> escuchela.. respirando&nbsp;<i>[?]</i></p><p><i>[Common]</i><br>Yo…on the amen, corner I stood lookin’ at my former hood<br>Felt the spirit in the wind, knew my friend was gone for good<br>Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn’t mask it<br>Mixin’ down emotions, struggle I hadn’t mastered<br>I choreograph seven steps to heaven<br>And hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leavened<br>Veteran of a cold war its chica-i-go for<br>What I know or, what’s known<br>So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home<br>From the crib I spend months gone<br>Sat by the window with a clutched dome listenin’ to shorties cuss long<br>Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong<br>Tried to call, or at least beep the lord, but didn’t have a touch-tone<br>Its a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on<br>Some of this land I must own<br>Outta the city, they want us gone<br>Tearin’ down the jects creatin’ plush homes<br>My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones<br>Surrounded by hate, yet I love home<br>Ask my God how he thought travellin’ the world sound<br>Found it hard to imagine he hadn’t been past downtown<br>Its deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep<br>Of reality I touch, but for me its hard to keep<br>Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep<br>Of reality I touch, but for me its hard to keep</p><p><i>[Mos Def and crew]</i><br>So much on my mind I just can’t recline<br>Blastin’ holes in the night till she bled sunshine<br>Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine<br>Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline<br>Yo how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call<br>I cant take it y’all, I can feel the city breathing<br>Chest heavin’, against the flesh of the evening<br>Kiss the ides goodbye, I’m on the last train leaving</p><p class=postsid
