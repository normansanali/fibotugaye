He’s cool,” <strong>Bradley Carter</strong> exclusively told Us Weekly at <a href=#>BravoCon</a> on Saturday, November 4, teasing “there’s definitely a little crossover moment” with Taylor, 28, who regularly stars on <a href=#>Southern Charm</a>.</p><p>Southern Hospitality star <a href=#><strong>Grace Lilley</strong></a> hinted that Taylor’s new man has “been around” so they have all met him while working at Republic Garden & Lounge. When asked if Gaston has “been around … in a bad way,” Grace, 25, played coy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Southern-Hospitality-Cast-Weigh-In-on-Taylor-Ann-Green-New-Boyfriend.jpg><p>Bradley, however, admitted, “Taylor has a type, and she loves the men that have been around.” He was seemingly referring to Taylor’s ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Shep Rose</strong></a>, who is known in Charleston, South Carolina, for being a ladies’ man.</p><p>Taylor and Shep, 43, split in July 2022, and she <a href=#>later accused him of cheating her throughout their relationship</a>. Shep has since apologized for hurting Taylor. Taylor <a href=#>exclusively told Us in October that she made her relationship with Gaston “official” about a month prior</a> after they began “talking” at the end of July.</p><p>Despite confirming Gaston has a way with the ladies, Bradley told Us on Saturday, “I’m not going to say a walking red flag.” Instead, he insisted that Gaston is a “cool guy” and a “nice” person.</p><p>The Southern Hospitality cast knows Gaston because he is their costar <strong>TJ Dinch</strong>’s roommate. That closeness, however, hasn’t made Gaston everyone’s favorite person, according to <strong>Joe Bradley </strong>who told Us on Saturday that the two men have “had some crossover with some girls.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Southern-Hospitality-Cast-Weigh-In-on-Taylor-Ann-Green-New-Boyfriend-2.jpg><p>While his costar <strong>Maddi Reese</strong> claimed Joe, 27, had “a little Gaston drama,” Joe told Us that was “not really” the case.</p><p>“I like the guy, but [the past drama] it is more over a girl, and I’m not the kind of guy that’s going to fight a guy over [a] girl,” Joe explained. “Charleston gets messy. There’s a reason why there’s two shows in a tiny town.”</p><p>Ultimately, <a href=#>the Southern Hospitality stars</a> all told Us they are <a href=#>rooting for Taylor to find The One</a>.</p><p>“I want the best for her. I feel like she seems really happy and in a better place and I love Taylor,” Maddi, 26, said, while Joe called Taylor a “salt of the earth” girl and “an amazing person.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Grace told Us she wants Taylor to “be happy,” and Bradley agreed. “That’s all that matters. If your friends are happy, we’re happy,” he added.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqoraSdsrO6jKGmrKiZqa6ttdOyZJyZo6l6pbXSoWSopl2prrq4zqtkmqaeYrSzscSnqmamlax6o7vYn6minZ6ZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
