According to data tracked by think tank Black Box Intelligence, the three pandemic takeout foods outperforming all others are pizza, burgers and chicken.</p><p>But let’s not forget the humble sandwich. What could be more satisfying&nbsp; than a hearty meal stuffed into heavenly bread? So here’s a round up of sammies with fillings you’ll crave.</p><p>Among these show-stoppers, we name our Sandwich of the Year for 2020: The Cubano from Fork and Knife in Costa Mesa.</p>Hungry? Sign up for The Eat Index, our weekly food newsletter, and find out where to eat and get the latest restaurant happenings in Orange County. <a href=#>Subscribe here</a>.<p>Much buzzed about on social media since its November debut, this panini became a favorite of Dean Kim, artisan breadmaker at OC Baking Company. His posts on Facebook whipped foodies and restaurant writers into a frenzy as he confessed his addiction, leading one friend to comment that he possibly “needs an intervention.”</p><p>They followed him to the source, posting their own raves, from “This sandwich cannot be overrated….” to “Damn you, Dean Kim.”</p><p>Chef Jonathan Blackford, who created the dish, typically gets menu inspiration from his travels, but during COVID he found it rewatching the movie “Chef” with his wife Kristi. “We were just randomly watching it and she was like, ‘Oh, that sandwich looks good!’ That’s kind of where it came from.”</p><p>He sold 350 the first month.</p><p>So his Cubano tops this list of&nbsp; ‘wiches worth seeking out. Be sure to call for hours, which can vary as restaurants continue to adapt to ever-changing rules and restrictions to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p><ul data-total=16><li data-index=1 readability=0.5><img data-sizes=auto style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/OCR-L-SANDWICH-0114-01.mr_.jpg><p class=slide-caption>Chef Jonathan Blackford and Kristi Blackford are the owners of Fork and Knife in Costa Mesa, on Thursday, January 7, 2021.

The Cubano at&nbsp; Fork and Knife:</strong> Chef Jonathan Blackford, formerly of Restaurant A and CdM, and his wife Kristi opened this <a href=#>gourmet takeout shop</a> specializing in elegant dinners, desserts, salads and fancy provisions. Other sandwiches are available 11 a.m.-3:30 p.m.,&nbsp; but the Cubano is sold all day.</p><p>It can be picked up cold, but it’s better ordered hot because the magic happens when it’s pressed on a panini and its subtle flavors come to luscious life. Slices of succulent roasted pork shoulder and house-cured ham are stacked on a fresh Röckenwagner ciabatta roll. It’s a double indulgence with pork as the star and dill pickle, Fallot mustard and domestic Swiss playing supporting roles. Price: $14. Find it:&nbsp; 401 E. 17th St., Suite A2, Costa Mesa, 949-877-0330, <a href=#>forkandknifecm.com.</a></p><p><strong>2. Slider at Dave’s Hot Chicken:</strong> This chain that started as a pop-up in East Hollywood has been blowing up lately, opening its <a href=#>first&nbsp; O.C. shop</a> earlier in January. One taste of its signature sandwich and we were hooked. They’re called sliders but they’re really full-sized buns, about the same as a McDonald’s regular burger.</p><p>Select a heat level when you order. Medium we were told is like Tapatio sauce or hot Cheetos and that was a perfect description. Mild is still flavorful and no spice is also tasty, but if you’re a pepperhead you might dare try the Reaper.</p><p>Each slider is stuffed with crispy chicken tenders; pickle slices and a bit of kale slaw add even more crunch. Condiments include Dave’s Sauce, honey and ketchup, but this sandwich can stand alone.&nbsp; Price: $5.45 for a single slider, $12.99 for a combo with two sliders and fries. Find it: 10832 Warner Ave, Fountain Valley, 657-383-7536, <a href=#>daveshotchicken.com.</a></p><p><strong>3. Spaghetti Grilled Cheese Sandwich at Burnt Crumbs:</strong> We can’t exclude this legendary creation filled with spaghetti and toasted like a grilled cheese. The Travel Channel’s Casey Webb, host of “Man v. Food,” swooped in to <a href=#>do a segment on it in 2018</a>. He compared it to his mom’s pasta dinners. “These guys took that and made it into a sandwich: garlic bread, spaghetti, sauce — but they kicked it up a notch, they made it spicy,” Webb said. Price: $11. Find it: 8549 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine, 949-502-5998, &nbsp;<a href=#>burntcrumbs.com.</a></p><p><strong>4. Lechon Sandwich at Papo’s Cuban Kitchen:</strong> Get in line behind the construction workers for these meaty, manly sandwiches. There’s an excellent skirt steak and others but the king is the <a href=#>lechon</a> with fatty slow-roasted pork and grilled onions on a huge hoagie roll, grilled with a bit of char on it. The sandwich comes with plantain chips, fries or tostones (fried, smashed plantains about the size of small pancakes). Mojo sauce cuts the richness. Price: $11. Find it: 2422 E. Katella Ave., Anaheim, 714-271-6262.</p><p><strong>5. Brussels Sprouts Banh Mi at Sessions West Coast Deli:</strong> Oversized sprouts are charred outside but still have a bit of fresh crunch. They’re doused in a chili aioli that soaks into the French roll, making this a joyfully messy knife-and-fork affair. Jalapeños add extra spice, and green and magenta watermelon radishes sliced on a mandoline make it Instagrammable. Price: $11. Find it: 4736 Barranca Parkway, Irvine, 949-333-3949; 101 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach, 949-554-4497; 414 Pacific Coast Highway, Huntington Beach, 714-594-3899; not available at Balboa Peninsula location. <a href=#>sessionswcd.com.</a></p><p><strong>6. Italian Hoagie at Philly’s Best Cheesesteaks:</strong> Most fans rave about the <a href=#>cheesesteak,</a> and it is legit. But we can’t get enough of the Italian. Capicola, Genoa salami and mortadella from Boar’s Head are piled high with provolone cheese. We recommend getting it made traditionally with oil, vinegar, oregano, lettuce and tomato, which give it that authentic Little Italy flavor when the sparky dressing soaks into the bread. Mmmmm! Price: $9.78. Find it: Locations throughout Southern California, <a href=#>eatphillysbest.com.</a></p><p><strong>7. Ronto Roasters’ Ronto Wrap at Galaxy’s Edge in Disneyland:</strong> When the new<a href=#> “Star Wars”-themed foods</a> rolled out they really looked like they flew in from another planet, but this one tempts earthlings with familiar ingredients. Thick, warm pita bread cradles a pork sausage that’s hot dog-like. It’s nicely grilled and only slightly spicy. Slices of mild roasted pork are nestled inside, along with coleslaw for a fresh veggie contrast and peppercorn sauce that adds a luxe note. Too bad we’ll have to wait until the park opens again to enjoy it. Price: $12.99. Find it: 1313 Disneyland Drive, Anaheim, 714-781-4636, <a href=#>disneyland.disney.go.com.</a></p><p><strong>8. Tandoori chicken sandwich at Maast Indian Cuisine:</strong> Tender tandoori chicken gets slathered with a cheesy queso and chutney, and you control the spice level. It’s grilled golden brown and the crinkle-cut fries it comes with can be “smothered” for $1 extra with more of that queso and chutney. Price: $9. Find it: 17951 Sky Park Circle, Unit F, Irvine, 909-306-6835, &nbsp;<a href=#>maastindian.com.</a></p><p><strong>9. The Big Blake at TidePoole’s Deli & Brew: </strong>It’s not strictly a Reuben but it is reubenesque, and you will be too if you get addicted to this deliciously decadent sandwich. Grilled fresh squaw bread adds a hint of sweetness, sauerkraut and coleslaw give it tang and texture. The pastrami’s edges are crisped like bacon; house-made Thousand Island dressing adds creaminess. Melted Swiss rounds it out but you could also get a provolone and corned beef version if you prefer. Price: $12. Find it: 6310 West Coast Highway, Newport Beach, 949-270-6547, <a href=#>tidepooles.com.</a></p><p><strong>&nbsp;10. Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket at Firehouse Subs:</strong> The brisket sandwich brings back Texas childhood memories of chopped barbecue on buns soaked with sauce. Tender slices of beef brisket smoked for up to 16 hours are nestled in a soft, white roll, then topped with melted cheddar and lots of Sweet Baby Ray’s Barbecue Sauce. You can feel good about indulging here; this shop has a permanent program to donate a portion of every sale to first responders and public safety organizations. Price: $7.54-$15.08. Find it: Locations throughout Southern California. <a href=#>firehousesubs.com.</a></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ytLGMmqmeZaSdsm59j2aZnqukYsCiusOwoJyglah6qrqMqKmappeaeqS71Kersmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
