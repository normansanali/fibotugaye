Delevingne opened up about their relationship in a new interview with <a href=#>The Times</a> on Saturday, July 6.</p><p>The catwalk queen dished on an eventful trip to the Glastonbury Festival with Minke, 31, where Delevigne was forced to admit she didn’t know who rocker Bruce Springsteen was.</p><p>“We teach each other so many things. Two years ago we were backstage at Glastonbury and we took a photo with this guy,” Delevingne told the outlet. “I said to Leah afterwards, ‘who was that?’ She was like, ‘What? That was Bruce Springsteen!’ I had no idea what he looked like. She thinks that’s blasphemy.”</p><p>The Paper Towns actress added she adores going to concerts with her ladylove and shared how they have a list of artists that they are planning to see in the near future.</p><p>Among the acts that the couple are going to catch are <strong>Girls Aloud</strong>, <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>, <strong>Troye Sivan</strong>, <strong>Robbie Williams</strong> and <strong>Stevie Nicks</strong>.</p><p>“Leah likes old rock, <strong>Fleetwood Mac</strong>, whereas I like R&B and old-school hip-hop, like the Notorious BIG,” Delevingne said. “And I love the wave of lesbians in music now, like <strong>Chappell Roan</strong> and <strong>Reneé Rapp</strong>.”</p><p>She’s also been anxiously waiting for the Spice Girls to reunite and tour again. “I pestered <strong>Victoria Beckham</strong> about it once at Glastonbury. She was like, ‘Please stop talking to me about that,’” the supermodel recalled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2159958280.jpg><p>Minke and Delevingne both went to the same boarding school, called Bedales, in Hampshire, England as teenagers. While they knew each other beforehand, they only reconnected several years ago.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The pair recently <a href=#>packed on the PDA</a> at Glastonbury on June 30.
