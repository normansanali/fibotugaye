Over the past decade, the 32-year-old writer-producer has become one of the most prolific and in-demand collaborators in Latin music, with a knack for <a href=#>elevating traditional styles across cultures</a> and a list of credits that includes stars like Alejandro Sanz and Maluma. What he did need, though, was a change of pace.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp09b3qa000c3b6zik6rwn97@published data-word-count=70>“I wanted to do things differently,” he explains. “I created my own label, and I wanted to support local acts from my hometown.” When Barrera first heard Frontera perform at a tire-shop opening near McAllen, Texas, the border town where he was raised, he saw a chance to develop the norteño band from the ground up. Soon enough, Barrera had become Frontera’s go-to producer and co-writer, like a seventh member.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp0a5ng3000v3b6z3i9xcfi7@published data-word-count=167>By April, they had one of the biggest songs in the world with “Un x100to,” a lovelorn cumbia track featuring Bad Bunny. Along with topping the charts in multiple countries, the song kicked off <a href=#>a Stateside boom</a> in regional Mexican music. It wasn’t just Frontera’s rhythmic, accordion-forward cumbias norteñas — it was heartfelt sierreño music from Eslabon Armado and the rising hip-hop-influenced corridos tumbados from Peso Pluma and Fuerza Regida. Barrera proved to be the perfect producer for this style-blending, borderless moment. He brought together giants of the genre, like Pluma and Frontera on “Tulum” and Frontera and Grupo Firme on “El Amor de Su Vida,” and even introduced Shakira to música mexicana for <a href=#>the song “El Jefe”</a> with Fuerza Regida.<strong> </strong>“I have got a lot of people saying, ‘Dude, we discovered this new sound of Mexican music, of Grupo Frontera,’” Barrera says. “We laugh because it’s a sound that’s very popular from the area where we’re from, and it has been since the 1960s and ’70s.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp07aris00553b7zf74hispp@published data-word-count=147>Now Barrera is the top nominee at this year’s Latin Grammys, up for 13 awards including Producer and Songwriter of the Year and Song of the Year for “Un x100to.” He also <a href=#>just added</a> a Songwriter of the Year nod for the larger 2024 Grammys. (Despite the nominations, the regional Mexican scene wasn’t fully embraced by Latin Grammy voters this year, with corridos tumbados acts receiving zero nominations; Barrera also represents the lone general-category nod for Latin music at the 2024 ceremony.) As he surveys the reach of música mexicana over the past year, he’s only more excited for the future. “All of this — Karol G doing this and Shakira doing that — is what’s going to get our culture bigger,” says Barrera, as he shares the stories behind four of his most genre-bending regional hits. “This whole movement’s going to be here for a while.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clp0563dt00113b7zjy67vih8@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Un x100to,” Grupo Frontera & Bad Bunny</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp056i4v00193b7zz5hohrnm@published data-word-count=141>If somebody would’ve told me that this was gonna happen, I would’ve never believed it. When we recorded this song, Payos, the singer of Grupo Frontera, said, “Dude, what if — can we get <a href=#>Bad Bunny</a> to feature on this song?” And I was just laughing. Bad Bunny is the biggest artist in the world. But I met his producer, MAG, at a BMI awards ceremony. We were just having a beer and talking about music, and he mentioned that Bunny was a big fan of the band. He was like, “When we’re in the studio listening to music and vibing, he’s listening to Grupo Frontera.” I couldn’t believe it. Two days later, he had recorded the song, and we were shooting the video three days after that. The turnaround of everything happened in a week and a half or so.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp056nwv001q3b7z9ixgnvz5@published data-word-count=154>This was all Benito. He wanted to respect the culture; he wanted to respect the band’s sound. So when he jumped onto the record, he’s like, “When I come in, I want to come in with my sound, and then they start coming in, and we blend and finish the song together.” This whole idea of changing the sound when he comes in, this was all his idea. It was the right way to do it. It’s a very traditional sound from our culture and our border where we grew up. Bunny wanting to come in and do something he’s never done before and respect the sound is an easy way for us to put it out there in the world. I think that’s the clever part. I was talking to some friends in Puerto Rico, and it’s really hard for Mexican music to go into the island. Now everybody’s listening to Grupo Frontera.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clp057p4b001z3b7zysv7e3bw@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Tulum,” Peso Pluma & Grupo Frontera</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp05896000283b7zs6j4p81r@published data-word-count=89>We have a really good relationship with Peso Pluma. We met way before Frontera made it and before he made it. We always say in order to make the genre bigger, we gotta work in collaboration. I remember “Un x100to” and “Ella Baila Sola” <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>were competing</span> on the charts. But between us, we were having fun. That just made us bond a lot more. We looked at it like, “Dude, we’re putting our culture out there.” And that’s when we decided, “Yo, what if we make a song together?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp058cg4002h3b7z2348ueb8@published data-word-count=104>As a writer, I always say that I write every genre. I just came last week from being in New York working on stuff in English. If a song is good enough to sing with guitar and vocals and connect like that, it’ll sound good with whatever genre you put it in. And that’s what I feel like with Peso Pluma and Frontera — they are in completely different genres, but at the end of the day, we both come from Mexico. We both admire songs from <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>Juan Gabriel,</span> from <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>José Alfredo Jiménez,</span> from <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-4 tabindex=0>Juan Sebastian</span> or <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-5 tabindex=0>Ariel Camacho.</span> That’s where we both connected.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clp059pak002y3b7zz5rrl8yv@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“El Jefe,” Shakira & Fuerza Regida</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp05qpve003s3b7zwbk54suq@published data-word-count=172>I flew out to L.A. to work with her and Keityn, the other co-writer of the song. Our idea was not to do a corridos tumbados song. It was supposed to be like a reggae-ska kind of vibe. For some reason, there was a <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-6 tabindex=0>12-string guitar</span> in the studio, and I was just fooling around and playing a bunch of stuff, playing the style of corridos. Shakira was like, “What is that?” And I was like, “Oh, this is the style that is going on in Mexico right now,” and she fell in love with it. She loved how original and how different it was from everything that was popping. So she was the one that had the idea of “Why don’t we do this song with that style but keeping it ska so it can have my vibe on it?” We wrote the song right there in the studio, we produced it together, and then Fuerza Regida hopped on the record. So now we have Shakira going into the Mexican world.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clp05qauf00383b7zmurdymun@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“Gucci Los Paños,” Karol G</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp05qth600433b7zxf7fchf4@published data-word-count=94>Karol is one of the few artists who actually started doing this type of sound years ago. She’s a big fan of Mexican music, and you can tell because it sounds authentic on her. That’s one thing I always try to find whenever I work with artists who want to do Mexican music but are not Mexican. Colombia and Mexico are very, very similar. I go to Colombia and I feel like I’m in Mexico because of the culture. Everybody there listens to Mexican music, and she has a real passion for Mexican music.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp07xlze006p3b7z8sv96e6r@published data-word-count=79>She told me she wanted to do one of those songs that sounds very <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-7 tabindex=0>despecho.</span> It’s a heartbreak song but urban style. Saying the only thing that hurts me about breaking up with you is because I bought all these handkerchiefs from Gucci, I’m throwing away all these Gucci handkerchiefs. I brought in this sound that was different for her: Ariel Camacho’s style, who’s&nbsp;a legend in música sierreño. We wanted to do this tribute to this type of music.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp07xlzf006q3b7zamy9iwqo@published data-word-count=69>She’s like, “What is this sound right here? I want that sound.” “Oh, that’s a tuba.” “Yes, I want a tuba in my song.” She gave me a lot of references. She loved the experiment of singing with the tuba. It’s really fun going to a show for Karol because you see a tuba player and you see an accordion, and it just makes the show feel more authentic.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clp0822hm007l3b7zsleeugnr@published data-word-count=9>This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clisff2iu000k0icm6kfijah5@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>How Peso Pluma is Leading a Mexican Regional Moment on the Charts</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl1v63amg000017n46w1cct3f@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>How Camila Cabello Brought Latin-Music History to the Present on&nbsp;Familia</span></a></li></ul><span role=tooltip id=annotation-1 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clp07dr5j005q3b7zsqil4agk@published class=annotation data-editable=text>And being positioned as opposites, following Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s praise of Frontera and <a href=#>criticism</a> of Pluma’s depiction of violence.</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-2 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clp07od2c00663b7zn745a3zw@published class=annotation data-editable=text>The genre-crossing singer-songwriter who was the best-selling Mexican musician of all time.</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-3 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clp07p5ho00683b7zozw46wue@published class=annotation data-editable=text>A formative Mexican ranchera musician.</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-4 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clp07qfxh006j3b7zu8v1t96h@published class=annotation data-editable=text>A prolific Mexican songwriter, mainly of banda music, who has won the most Grammys of any Mexican artist.</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-5 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clp07thfj006l3b7z75qn0qno@published class=annotation data-editable=text>The young singer-songwriter who helped popularize anguished sierreño music in the mid-2010s.</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-6 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clp07wixf006n3b7zf9dhph6i@published class=annotation data-editable=text>Which makes a fuller sound and is essential to styles like corridos.</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-7 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/clp084ftl007r3b7ztxwm1pxv@published class=annotation data-editable=text>Spiteful.</span> <span class=ambrose-short-hed>Edgar Barrera’s Genre-Bending Vision for Música Mexicana</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdhZnymsMaaqWaakae%2Fpr7AZqmen5mku6K4jKacsaGTlrtuudSsoJxll6fCsbuMn6mopqSav6J6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
