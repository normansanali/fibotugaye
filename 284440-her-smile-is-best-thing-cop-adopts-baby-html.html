On Valentine's Day in 2018, the couple discovered that the same woman wanted them to adopt her child.</p><p class=Zg>The world is full of kind-hearted and genuine souls who never think twice before helping others. People in uniforms are often misunderstood for being rude, unfair, and uncooperative. But a California police officer's kind act proves otherwise.</p><p class=Zg>Officer Jesse Whitten from the Santa Rosa Police Department never thought that a <strong class=Xg>chance encounter with a homeless woman</strong> would change his life forever.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>[Left] Ashleigh and Jesse Whitten with their kids.

Amongst them was <strong class=Xg>a woman he met on patrol in 2017, </strong>who was going through a rough patch in her life. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/human-interest/jesse-whitten-adopt-homeless-baby-felt-right/>told</a> PEOPLE:</p><p class=Zg>â€œShe was very honest about her situation, how she was struggling with drug addiction and what was going on in her life."</p><p class=Zg>Jesse often checked up on her as a benevolent man and offered to take her to a shelter. The Santa Rosa cop also drove her to a detox and rehab center.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>AN UNEXPECTED FRIENDSHIP</strong></p><p class=Zg>Over time, Officer Jesse and the woman living on the streets <strong class=Xg>forged an unexpected friendship.</strong> Jesse recalled that his wife, Ashley Whitten, accompanied him on a ride-along one day, and they ran into the same woman.</p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>The Santa Rosa Police Department joined in the Whitten family's celebration and congratulated them in a Facebook post shared on September 1, 2018.</strong></h3><p class=Zg>Soon, the two ladies started talking about motherhood, and <strong class=Xg>the homeless woman put Ashley's hand on her belly. </strong>As it turned out, the woman was expecting, and Ashley didn't know about the connection she shared with the baby.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Officer Jesse Whitten with his adoptive daughter, Harlow Maisey Whitten. | Photo: YouTube.com/Good Morning America</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>THE SURPRISING PHONE CALL</strong></p><p class=Zg>According to PEOPLE, the woman gave a photo of her ultrasound to Officer Jesse and asked if he and Ashley would adopt her baby. Jesse didn't know how serious she was until she delivered the baby on February 9, 2018.</p><p class=Zg>Despite trying to stay clean, the woman's baby girl was born with heroin traces in her system. Because she was homeless and the baby had drugs in her system, the county asked her if she wished to arrange for emergency placement in foster care.</p><p class=Zg>Instead, she told them to call Officer Jesse. So on Valentine's Day in 2018, the Whittens received a call that said <strong class=Xg>the biological mom specifically wanted them to adopt her baby.</strong></p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Ashley and Jesse Whitten with their adoptive daughter, Harlow Maisey Whitten. | Photo: YouTube.com/Good Morning America</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>WELCOMING AN ANGEL</strong></p><p class=Zg>Ashley shared that the woman had envisioned a perfect life for her child, but she couldn't give it to her because of her condition. She trusted Officer Jesse would do what she couldn't. The California cop shared he couldn't be happier.
