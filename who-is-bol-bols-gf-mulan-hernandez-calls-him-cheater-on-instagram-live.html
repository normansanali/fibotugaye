That <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sh-t is narcissistic</a> as f–k and nobody’s about to sit here and make me feel bad. He just sat here and tried to make me feel bad. He just sat here and told, ‘I could never have a life, I’m on the game,’ and y’all he’s in the house with a bitch.”</p><p>She added: “I’m not going to regret this. So I don’t give a f–k about him… his feelings… he’s sitting there with some b—h right now while I’m mourning my brother. You’re really really really really just sick in the head you really are… I’m saying what I’m saying.”</p><h2 class=split>Who is Bol Bol's GF?</h2><p>There is not much information about Hernandez. Also, it’s not widely reported how she met the Sudanese-American professional basketball player. But it's been said that the relationship between the two began in the beginning of 2021. The 20-year-old is a social media model and also has an OnlyFans account. She is quite active on social media sharing her pictures, videos and reels. Her latest post was shared on new year that showed her flaunting her curves in a body-fit, revealing shimmery short dress. She captioned the pictures as “Stepped into 2022 like…”</p><p>Besides, her recent Instagram Story slides also hinted towards her broken heart as the first photo in the series read, “When Cardi B said ‘it’s gunna hurt me to hate you, but lovin you is worse’ that hit me.” She also shared a post from @rendezvous4you that stated, “I want a soft connection. I want to feel at ease. I want to be asked how my day went and if i need anything. I want forehead kisses. I want car ride thigh rubs & I want the back of my hand kissed at red lights. I want to be asked how i’m mentally feeling.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/8926984f-7188-410f-b2ae-1a39aa4bb572.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/cd7c2236-79c4-46a5-8630-15cde6fac5b6.png><p>“I want to hold hands everywhere we go. I want to be uplifted. I want romantic gestures. I want my hair played in.. i want to be taken care of. I want soft back rubs at the most unexpected moments. I want to know you always got me. I want silent eye connections that lead to smiles & laughs. a good nervousness. The butterflies are still there.. I want a genuine bond, love and friendship that is secure,” the post added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJumpWWSpLm0ecafZKatnJa7brTEq6WappSax26vwKWjrGWYnrpur8eemK2domK8r3nIp6qtmZenrq55y6Ktng%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
